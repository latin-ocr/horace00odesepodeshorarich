out arcu or cornu (see Aen. 9. 606 and 9. 590), arcu paterno is, perhaps, an
emphatic addendum (see on P. 5 3); the boy is a skilled archer like his fathers
before him.

10-12. arduis...montibus: for the grouping see on P. 8. The juxtaposition
of arduis and pronos is happy.

ι 3. tu is emphatic because inserted i.e. ‘you of all people 3'

ι 3, ¹4· nobilis is surely genitive. For the grouping coemptos. ..nobilis Ι libros
Poemaeti see on P. 9.

compto· undique: compare on odes ι. 7. 7; but undique, by position,
may go with both nobilis and coemptos.

Sooeaticam (ps): the founder os the school is naturally mentioned before
his disciples. Moreover there is artificial antithesis to Panaeti.

XXX. 2, 3. dilectam (p) i.e. ‘though dear to thee.¹

vocantis...th0erae is preposited because it is the equivalent os an abla-
tive absolute. The order, therefore, is the natural order os events: Glycera
<alls and Venus answers by coming.

multo, being postposited and separated, is emphatic.

te is object of vocantis and, later, of transfer.

3, 4. decoram (ps): the adjective suggests both beauty and fitness (for
the latter sense compare Livy Presl 56, 2. ¹3- ιο, 2. 24. 5, 36. ¹4- 5). lts
position makes it mean ‘because beautiful and worthy of thee! See also
P. 21.

5- levidus tecum puer: probably a Roman feels se transferat or the like
with tecum. in which case fervidus is predicative. On the other hand it is
tempting to read tecum first with ser-zn'dus (i.e. the puer is servilius ⁴ with
thee‚' just as in l. 7 luventas is parum comis· ‘without thee ') and. later on.
with propheten see P. 50 e.

5, 6. notu& Ι Gratiae zonis: for the position os Gratiae see on Odes
