114 · HORACE

urbes relinquam. non ego pauperum 5
sanguis parentum, non ego quem vocas,
dilecte Maecenas, obibo
nec Stygia cohibebor unda.

iarn iam residunt cruribus asperae
pelles et album mutor in alitem 10
superne nascunturque leves
per digitos umerosque plumae.

iam Daedaleo notior Icaro
visam gementis litora Bosphori
Syrtisque Gaetulas canorus 15
ales Hyperboreosque campos.

5. non separated from its verb and repeated is very emphatic and amounts
to numquam.

pauperum (μὴτ the pause at the end of the line adds to the emphasis;
but see also P. 20 α.

6. quem vocas: everything depends upon the tone of the Ode. Those
who take it seriously must admit that the third stanza is perilously near the
ridiculous. Fancy the tubby Horace ‘dolled up' as a bird! In this line an
attempt is made to put an elevated interpretation on vocas (eg. ‘dost summon
to poetic endeavour'). But such an attempt introduces an idea opposed to
the demands of the context. Horace says ‘1, though oflow descent‚ I whom...,
shall never die,' and the blank space can be filled only by some depreciatory
notion eg. ‘whom men despise'3 hence Bentley's quem vocant (sc. pauperum
sanguinem), and Gow's z'ocas=‘banter’ (see C. R. vol. XXIX p. 26).

But if the tone of the Ode is half-jesting, we obtain a satisfactory sense
from the reading quem vocas, viz. ‘1 who am of humble origin, Ι whom you
ask to your table, I a poor client, I a solid piece of flesh, fond of my dinner‚
Ι, moi qui ῥανίε, shall never die, but suffer a sky-change.'

7. dilecte (p) i.e. ‘dean dear Maecenas'3 but see on P. 36.

8. Stygia (ps) i.e. ‘by Styx (and its waters)⁷; see on Odes 1. 33. 16. Com-
pare too on P. 21.

9. asperae (p) : conti-ast leves of l. 11. In any case the human leg should
be smooth, not wrinkled and rough.

10. pelles has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); contrast cutis, the human
skin. Compare too Juvenal 10. 92 deformem pro cute pellem.

album (ps) i.e. ‘into the whiteness (of a swan)'; see on P. 27 and P. 21.

11. superne(pps): placed late and alone at the beginning of the line (see
on Odes 4. 9. 26), it is in artificial contrast to cruribus, as if Horace had
written κάτω μὲν μέλας-...ἅνω δέ ἀργός.

leves: the slight pause at the end of the line gives stress in contrast to
asperae of l. 9. The adjective goes closely with nascuntur i.e. ‘there are born
smooth over fingers and shoulders the seathers.’
