Carthagini iam non ego nuntios
mittam superbos: occidit, occidit 70
spes omnis et fortuna nostri
nominis Hasdrubale interempt0.'

nil Claudiae non perficient manus.
quas et benigno numine luppiter
defendit et curae sagaces 75
expediunt per acuta belli.

V.

Divis orte bonis, optume Romulae

custos gentis, abes iam nimium diu;

maturum reditum pollicitus patrum
sancto concilio, redi.

68. coniugibus: the commentators say ‘wives’ or ‘widona’ But may not
the picture be of husband and wife, at table or over the fire, talking about
past campaigns (see Ovid Her. 1. 3o)? Just as reges can mean ‘king and
queen.' so com‘uges can mean ⁸ man and wife!

69. iam non (s): the adverbial combination is emphatic.

ego is emphatic because inserted i.e. οὐκ ἔγωγι, whatever others may do.

70. superbo· (s) i.e. lais messengers can only be tristes, trepidi. See too
P. 21.

71. omnis (pp) has emphasis. lt is also in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position with spes
andsortuna.

nocui (p): contrast Romani.

72. Hasdrubale interempto: see on Odes 3. 1. 34. 'I'he clause is an em-
phatic addendum (see on P. 5 3), and stresses the extent of the disaster.

73. Claudiae (μὴτ the adjective amounts to ‘the Claudii‘; see on Odes
1. 15. 33. For manus see Odes 1. 3. 16.

, 74. benigno (p) i.e. ‘ by the kindness (οἵ his will)’; see on P. 27.

75, 76. defendit may have some stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) in contrast
to expediunt: Jupiter defends, skill'ul diligt-nce extricates from peril. The
sentiment is ‘Thank God and the British Navy.'

V. 1, 2. bonis (s): contrast iratis or the like. Compare Odes 1. 1. 1 atavis
edite ngibus. For an intervening vocative see on Odes 1. 5. 3. See too
P. 2⁴-

opt-mammes. for the grouping see P. 9.

iam nimium diu (pmz the adverbs are emphatic.

3. 4. mttumm (p): contrast tardum, serum.

patntm (p) i.e. ‘the fathers (in august council),’ as if we had patribus (see
on P. 38); hence the normal order sancto patrum concilio is abandoned (see
on P. 43). ‘rhe preposited sanctus is common with senatus eg. Vergil Aen.
