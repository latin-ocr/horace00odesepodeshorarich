haec ubi locutus faenerator Alfius,
iam iam futurus rusticus,
omnem redegit Idibus pecuniam,
quaerit Kalendis ponere. 70

ΙΙΙ.

Parentis olim siquis impia manu
senile guttur fregerit,
edit cicutis alium nocentius.
o dura messorum ilia!
quid hoc veneni saevit in praecordiis? 5
num viperinus his cruor
incoctus herbis me fefellit, an malas
Canidia tractavit dapes?
ut Argonautas praeter omnis candidum
Medea mirata est ducem, 10
ignota tauris illigaturum iuga
perunxit hoc Iasonem,
hoc delibutis ulta donis paelicem
serpente fugit alite.

69. ornnem (s) has emphasis i.e. ‘ every single farthing of....'

111. 1, 2. Parentis (ps)...impia (p)...seni1e (p): the horror of the crime
is brought out by the order3 it is a crime against afatlzer (see too P. 43), the
hand therefore is impia (see too on Odes 2. 14. 23), the victim is old 'and can-

not protect himself.
olim, by its emphatic position, almost equals umquam3 the horror is nearly

unthinkable.
3. cicutis is emphatic; it should lie between alium and nocentius. See on

P. .

469, 7. viperinus his cruor Ι incoctus herbis: as incoctus is merely an
elongation of the preposition in, the grouping is that noted at P. o.

malas (ps) i.e. ι(εὶ feast) that is poisonous ’; compare C. S. 71, and note on
Odes 2. 14. 23.

9. omnis (ahs) has stress.
candidum (ps) i.e. ‘the fair complexion (of their leader)'; see on P. 27,

and compare Odes 2. 4. 3 niveo.
11. ignota...iuga: for the grouping, with illzgratm-um intrusive see on

P. 46. The participle illzgraturum is causal ; hence its separation from Iasonem.
No doubt tauris is dative with both ignota and illzjgalmvmt.

13. hoc goes closely with delibutis (ps) i.e. ‘thus anointed were the gifts
with which....' Compare Epod. 5. 74 mztltczfleturmn.
