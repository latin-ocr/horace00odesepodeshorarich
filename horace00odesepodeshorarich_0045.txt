ont-:s 1. ²-3 9

tollat3 hic magnos potius triumphos,
hic amen dici pater atque princeps, μ
neu sinas Medos equitare inultos,

te duee, Caesar.

111.

Sic te diva potens Cypri,
sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
ventorumque regat pater
obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga,
navis, quae tibi creditum 5
debes Vergilium, finibus Atticis
reddas incolumem precor
et serves animae dimidium meae.

48. ocior (p) i.e. ‘all too swift’ : comparatives are naturally prepositive;
see P. 28.

49. tollat has stress ; contrast lu'c. See on Odes 4. 9. 26.

potius is emphasized by separation from lu‘c. See P. sos.

51, 52. inultos Ι ...:Caoear sor these emphatic addenda see P. 53.

52. te duee: Horace writes an ablative absolute as if ne Medi equitent
had preceded.

111. 1. te diva: see on Odes 1. 2. 17.

potens Cypri: C spn' may stand outside diva potens because we still wait
for an object; see P. 47. On the other hand objective genitives more often
precede (see P. 39), and it is hard to see why Horace should not have written
diva Cspri potens. See too P. 44.

2. lueida (p): perhaps equals ‘not obscured by stormst wldeham, Gow,

, and others, in view of Pliny N-H. 2. 101 (ch. xxxvtl) and Statius Silv. 3. 2. 8,

see a reference to St Elmo’s fire; but the stars Castor and Pollux may be
meam. Tbese rise in front os the Lion. and are brilliant objects in the evening
sky from January to April i.e. during most os the stormy months. To pray
that they may be bright is to pray sor fine weather at such a time. See on
Odes 1. 12. 27, 3. 29. 64, and 4. 8. 3¹· Had Vergil been travelling in the
mmet, Horace would scarcely have been so anxious. Compare too odes
4. 14. 21.

3- venatorum (ps) equals ‘and as sor winds may their father...’ ; see P. 40.
The word ventorum is brought close to sidera in artificia! antithesis.

5, 6. quae tibi creditum Ι debet: the sentence may be felt as complete

ἶ at debes, for creth’tum can be quasi-substantival (τὴν παρακαταθήκην); this

gives Vergilium some emphasis—⁸ even Vergil! But see also P. 21.
7. incolumen: predicative.
8. anituae dimidium meae: for the grouping see P. ¹9 and 200.
