220 HORACE

et cantu ‘tremulo pota Cupidinem ¹ 5
lentum sollicitas. ille virentis et
doctae psallere Chiae
pulchris excubat in genis,

importunus enim transvolat aridas
quercus et refugit te quia luridi 10
dentes te quia rugae
turpant et capitis nives.

nec Coae referunt iam tibi purpurae
nec clari lapides tempora, quae semel
notis condita fastis ¹5
inclusit volucris dies.

XIII. 1. mea (p): whatever they have done in the case of other
people.

6, 7. virentis...Chiae: this genitive group comes early as if it were the
object of some verb for which the reader waits (see on P. 38). One may read
it thus: ‘He (loves) fresh beauty‚ skill on the lyre; he loves Chia and keeps
watch on her fair cheeks.’

virentis (p) i.e. ‘the freshness‚ fresh beauty (of Chia)'; see on P. 27.

8. pulchris (ps): see on P. 21. The adjective is causal i.e. ‘because they
are fair.'

9. aridas (p) i.e. ‘the dryness (of oaks)'; see on P. 27.

10. quercus should have stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26). The word comes
as a paraprosdokian3 we are half expecting anus; we find a gnarled oak‚ the
symbol of longevity.

te has emphasis because it follows refigi& it is also object of turpant.

luridi (p) i.e. ‘the dirtiness (of teeth)'; see on P. 27.

11. dentes: if a comma is put after this word (instead of after te) there
is offensive stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26). The dirty teeth stick out, as it
were.

te, emphatic because preceding quia, unpleasantly echoes te of l. 10. See
too P. 51.

12. capitis (p): as if we had in capite. Horace travels up the face; first
those awful teeth, then the wrinkled face and brow, and then the head and
white hair.

13. Coae (ps) i.e. not even Coan purple (the very best) and its transparent
material.

iarn (pp) i.e. it is too late, too late!

14. clari (p) i.e. ‘the flash (of stones)'; see on P. 27. The reading cari
will be concessive ‘though costly.'

semel (s) i.e. ‘once for all,' said with stress.

15. notis (ps): every one knows your age. See P. 24.
