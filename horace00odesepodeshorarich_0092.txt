56 HORACE
XXIX.

leci, beatis nunc Arabum invides
gazis et acrem militiam paras
non ante devictis Sabaeae
regibus horribilique Medo

nectis catenas? quae tibi virginum 5
sponso necato barbara serviet?
puer quis ex aula capillis
ad cyathum statuetur unctis,

doctus sagittas tendere Sericas
arcu paterno? quis neget arduis 10
pronos relabi posse rivos
montibus et Tiberim reverti,

XXIX. 1, 2. nunc separated from invides has emphasis. The sense is,
as Wickham says, ‘What, now, after a lisetime spent in such different pursuits.'
For the intrusive nunc and invides see P. 46 b. A Roman could read this
line thus: ‘What, Iccius, are the happy Arabians now your envy and—for
their treasures?’

gazis by position (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) has interest. The sense is ‘Do
you, a kindly philosopher, envy the happy and for so sordid a reason—their
wealth?'

acrem (p) i.e. the pains (of military service); see on Ρ. 27, and on Odes
2. 14. 23. Compare odes 1. 18. 5 gravem (p) 7222'lz'tz'am, and 3. 2. 2 acri (p)
militia.

3, 4. non ante...regibus: unless we put a stop at paras, these words form
an emphatic addendum3 see on P. 53.

horribili (β) echoes non ante devictis. See too on Odes 2. 14. 2 3.

5. quae tibi virginum: for the early grouping of case relations see on
Odes 1. 2. 17.

6. barbara seems to go with serviet i.e. like a barbarian, and no Roman,
she will be your slave.

7. puer precedes quis in artificial contrast to virginum l. 5 above3 cp.
prece qua of Odes 1. 2. 26.
capillis: when a Roman reads this word, he at once thinks of intonsus,
κομῶν. ·

8. unctis is little more than unctus3 the boy will stand, smelling of per-
fume on his hair, and ‘on his hair' is brought back to mind by the case-
ending.

9. Sericas (s): we are reaching the extreme limit of the empire which
Iccius is to conquer. We began modestly with Arabia; then came Parthia,
and now it is China too. See also P. 21.

10. arcu paterno: as the phrase sagittas tendere may stand with or with-
