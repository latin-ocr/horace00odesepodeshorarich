2 Ἴ χ,4 t HORACE

certat tergeminis tollere honoribus ;

illum, si proprio condidit horreo

quicquid de Libycis verritur areis. 10
gaudentem patrios findere sarculo

agros Attalicis condicionibus ⁵

numquam demoveas, ut trabe Cypria

Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare;

luctantem Icariis fluctibus Africum 15
mercator metuens otium et oppidi

laudat rura sui: mox reficit rates

quassaS, indocilis pauperiem pati.

7, 8. mobilium (ps) equals ‘though fickle, they yet give him all three
offices,² tergeminis (ps). But the order &nobilium turba Quiritium is frequent
(see P. 19 and 20a); and so is the grouping tergeminis tollere honoribus (see
P. 21).

9. proprio (ps) i.e. all his own, not shared in partnership nor owned bv
the government. Compare privatis Odes 2. 15. 15, meis Odes 3. 16. 27, Epod.
1. 26, and suis Epod. 2. 3. But see too P. 21.

10. Libycis (ps): the corn comes, not from his own estate, but from
Afm‘ca; also see P. 21.

11. patrios (ps): this man delights in his ancestral farm, however small.
Contrast Libycz's...a7‘ez's of l. 10, and see on proprio l. 9 above.

12. Attalicis (p): the generic adjective is often, as one would expect, pre-
positive. See P. 37.

14. Myrtoum: perhaps the worst sea in the Mediterranean (cp. Odes 4.
5. 9, 10), off Cape Malia, enough to frighten an experienced sailor‚ much more
a novice. One need not be a confirmed believer in Porphyrion's speciem pro
genere ponit. See on Odes 1. 35. 7.

For the two adjectives Myrtoum pavidus followed by the two nouns in
chiastic order see P. 10, and for the collocation of the adjectives see Odes
1. 5. 9.

mare: single word after the verb, as so often in Livy.

15. Icariis (p) : again the sea is the dangerous Aegean. See too
P. 10.

16, 17. otium et oppidi: a Roman reads this as ‘retirement and town';
for though oppidi is genitive, he feels it to be object of laudat ‘until rura is
reached; see P. 38, and Ρ. 20 a.

sui (s): the word probably has emphasis; it is an emphatic asterthought
(see Ρ. 53)—‘ this is his own, his native land.’ So he thinks on the stormy
waters, but soon....

18. quassas standing alone at the commencement os the line has stress
(see 011 Odes 4. 9. 26). The participle is concessive-‘ although the storm‚
now forgotten‚ had shattered them.'
