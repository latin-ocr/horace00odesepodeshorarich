ODES 111. 1-2 119

cur invidendis postibus et novo ⁴³
sublime ritu moliar atrium?
cur valle permutem Sabina
divitias operosiores?

Angustam amice pauperiem pati
robustus acri militia puer
condiscat et Parthos ferocis
vexet eques metuendus hasta

vitamque sub divo et trepidis agat 5
in rebus. illum ex moenibus hosticis
matrona bellantis tyranni
prospiciens et adulta virgo

4 5. invidendis (p) has natural emphasis. See too on Odes 2. 14. 23.

45. 46. novo...⁸trium: for the grouping see on P. 9.

47. sabim (s) is brought next to divitias as a reminder os the dis-
ciplina tetrica ac tn'stis veterum Sabinorum (Livy 1. 18. 4). See also
Ρ. 21.

11. 1. Angustam (ps) i.e. ‘the pinch (os humble circumstances)'; see on
P. 27.

amice: this adverb has stress by separation from pati i.e. ῥᾳδίως καὶ οὗ
χαλεπαῖς. But its position between Aug-ustam and pauperiem is awkward‚
and perhaps we should accept amia·(vocative); sor the position os which see
on Odes 1. 5. 3.

2. aeri (p) i.e. ‘the hardships (of warsare)'; see on P. 27, and 011 Odes
2. 14. 23. Compare too 011 Odes 1. 29. 2. But the grouping robustus...puer
may be classified under Ρ. 10.

4. ham lies outside eques and ›netuendus because it modifies vexet also.
See 011 Ρ. 49, and compare Odes 2. 18. 38, 39.

ς. trepidis (ps) i.e. in peril, not security. Compare Nietzsche's ‘Live
dangermasly.· See too P. 21.

6- in rebus has emphasis (see on odes 4. 9. 26) 1.0. 111 action, 1101 111
1111011055.

inmn...matrona: the picture is made vivid by the order: the Roman
iuvem& is the object (as shown by the case) from the enemy's walls of the
mother's gne (see on Odes 1. 2. ¹7)-

7. bannus (p) by chiasmus echoes hosticae.

8. miden! by its position qualifies both matrona and virgo.

adulta (p): 511015 oid enough to feel the 5111 os sexual 0111011011, as suspiret
eheu shows.
