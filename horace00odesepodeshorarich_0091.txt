26. Ηωραὶίινωυιὶωετ the collocation seems tobe intentional. Horace
means the Italian (Hesperiis) coast on the side os Venusia The word Hes·
perir) might be misleading but sor the immediate definition supplied by
Venusinae, which shows that Hespen'rlr here means eastern. Compare on
odes 1. 3⁶· 4.

Venusinae (ps): see on P. 21.

27. te sospite is an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53) i.e. ‘while thou
art saie)

28. aequo (ps) i.e. ⁸ from the kindness (οἱ Jove)'; see on P. 27.

29. neri custode Tarenti: sor the grouping see on P. 202.

Tarenti: there is, to my mind, nothing unnatural in this reference. We
may assume that the sailor started from Tarentum on his voyage to Greece
and that the Eurus of l. 25 forced him into the Italian coast as soon as he

Tarentum was tlte port par excellence, just as Hull would be to a Scarborough
fisherman.

for the grouping see on P. 9. To take te as subject of committere is to play
fast and loose with Latin order. See too on l. 33.

32. debit· iura vicesque superbae is, perhaps, a chiasmus; but debita (p)
has sti-ess i. e. rights that are debita, non soluta. The iura sepulchri, says the

ghost, may never be paid 111 your case.

33. te.. Apsum is in emphatic contr-ast to te natis os l.31.

iniamus) has stt-ess: see too on P. 21.

34 te· forits position see on P. 51.

35. lunga forms part οἷ the predicate. As an epithet longa would normally
be preposited.

tiabit perhaps has stress (see on nullum l. ¹9) i.e. ‘you are perfectly
