shadows are beginning to change (mutaret is inceptive imperfect) to the
eastern side; the sun is passing the zenith3 his chariot no longer adit but
abi! (hence l. 44 amate is preposhed, and the phrase abeunte curru comes as
an addendum of interest; see P. 53).

Since uri-iring this note l came across Dr Frazer's article in C. R. vol. n.
p. aeq where he takes the same view as 1. Mr Rogers in his translation of
the Bit-dr in an additional note on l. 1500 adversely criticizes the view os
Dr Frater, but does not, in my opinion, compel conviction. The passage in
Horace’s Epnktlaes ι. 16. 5-7 seems to bear out Frazer's interpretation.

41. montium (ps) is logical object (see on P. 38) i.e. ‘was changing the
mountains in respect os shadow.‘

42. mutaret-demeret: the mood is, 1 venture to think, Livian frequen-
tative subjunctive.

umbra: see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

43. {micum (ῤ) i.e. τὸν φίλον καὶ οὗ χαλεπὸν καιρόν. The words bobus
sangrum may be read with it as well as with demeret. Compare on 1. 28. 2 3.

⁴5· &muoso (ps)i.e. ‘the thefts(ostime)’; seeon P. 27 and Odes 2. ¹⁴· 23.

dien: seeon Odes 1. 3. 16.

47. mox...vifioeiorem is an unpleasant addendum (see on Ρ. 53). The
whole sunta is a neat ⁸This-is-the-house-that-Jack-built¹ piece os work.

vn. 1, 2. candidi...1··avonii: sor the grouping see on P. 8. ln speaking
of Favonius Horace thinks merely of spring, not os the most suitable wind
to bring Gyges home.

3-5. Thymmssygm: these lines are emphatic addenda: see on P. 53.
Tbeoe is a crescendo: he has been prosperetis, he is true, he is your Gyges.
Compare Livy 34. 5. 2 vir gravissimus, consul. M. Porcius.

3- Thym (p) emphasizes the distance of his trax-eis.

4. oemtanfls...fldei: sor the grouping see on P. 20 β.

5. Gygen: the position shows that here is the climax (see on odes 4 9. 26).
