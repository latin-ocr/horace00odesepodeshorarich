, bracchia et vultum teretisque suras
integer laudo: suge suspicari,
cuius octavum trepidavit aetas
claudere lustrum.

V.

Nondum subacta ferre iugum valet
cervice, nondum munia comparis
aequare nec tauri ruentis
in venerem tolerare pondus.

circa virentis est animus tuae 5
campos iuvencae, nunc fluviis gravem
solantis aestum, nunc in udo
ludere cum vitulis salicto

16. iniquos (s) i.e. ‘because ill-fated.’ Note the chiasmus regium genus...
penatis iniquos ; but see also P. 21.

17. non, of course, goes with illam i.e. μὴ ἐκείνην γε; not she, whatever
be the case with your other ladies.

illam tibi: note case relations grouped together ; see on Odes 1.
2. 17.

scelesta (p): see on Odes 2. 14. 23. The position prepares us for and is
echoed by pudenda 1. 20.

21. ‘ceretis (p) i.e. ‘the shapeliness (of her suras)'; see on P. 27.

23. cuius belongs first to octavum (sc. lustrum) and then to aetas.

octavum (s) i.e. his quartum or quintum lustrum might have been
dangerous⁷ but not his octavum.

V. 1. subacta: one cannot help thinking that a Roman would read this
as nominative (assuming that a short vowel may stand here in arsis cp. Odes
1. 3. 36, 2. 6. 14, 2. 13. 16, 3. 5. 17, 3. 16. 26, 3. 23. 18); when cervice is
reached, he might resume subacta as ablative. The absence of any expressed
nominative feminine makes valet very obscure.

2. cervice may be taken as ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ferre and aequare; this would
excuse its lonely position (see on Odes 3. 17. 15).

3. tauri (ps) i.e. ‘the bull (and its weight)'; see on P. 38. There is also
the antithesis os comparis (ox) and bull.

4. in venerem: for the order see on P. 47.

5, 6. virentis...tuae Ι campos iuvencae: for the grouping see P. 9.

gravem (ps) i.e. ‘the burden (of the heat)'; see on P. 27, and Odes
2. 14. 233 also on Ι). 21.

7. in udo: this can first be read as a noun (⁴in the wet⁷)‚ as so often in
Livy e.g. in ‘sicco 1. 4. 6 ; on reaching salicto a Roman may resume udo as an
adjective. Compare obliquo laborat...rivo at Odes 2. 3. 11, and see P. 27.
