quicumque mundo terminus obstitit.
hunc tanget armis. visere gestiens, .
qua parte debacchentur ignes, 35
qua nebulae pluviique rores.

sed bellicosis fata Quiritibus
hac lege dice, ne nimium pii
rebusque fidentes avitae
tecta velint reparare Troiae. 60

Troiae renascens alite lugubri
fortuna tristi clade iterabitur,
ducente victrices catervas
coniuge me lovis et sorore.

ter si resurgat murus aeneus 65
auctore Phoebo, ter pereat meis
excisus Argivis, ter uxor
capta virum puerosque ploret.'

outside rapiente and dextra (see on P. 49), and the phrase humanos in usus
goes with rapiente as well as with cogere. For the late ablative absolute see
on Odes 3. t. 3⁴·

53. mundo is, perhaps, felt first with quicumque terminus as if mutuli,
and then with obstiti& but Bentley's quacumque is tempting. See however on
oaes t. 27· ιι, 12.

55. ignes comes last to prepare us for the antithesis nebulae.

56. pluvii (ps) i.e⁴ ‘the rain (os dew)'; see P. 27. The phrase is a good
description οἱ a Scotch mist. But pluvii, by position, may qualify both nebulae
and roten see on P. 33. Compare odes 1. 22. ¹9·

57. bellicosis (ps) i.e. despite their prowess in war l dictate terms to

59, ⁶0. avitae Ι tecta...‘rroiae: for the order see on P. 20 α. But a Roman
may feel avitas with tecta (see on P. 52). The stress on avitae brings out the
point: Rome must not think os restoring the past. The position oi Troiae
emphasizes the particular object of the prohibition.

61. Troiae (ps) is really subject (see on P. 38), and picks up the previous
Troiae as a sort os rhetorical connective.

62. nisti (p) reiterates chiastically the lugubri of 1. 61. See also on odes
2. 14. 23.

⁶3. victrices (p) is heard with ducente as if in victor-iam.

64. lovis, by position, qualifies both coniuge and sorore.

65. tu (s) is emphatic.

66, 67. meis (ps): perhaps ⁸ my beloved ’ς see on Odes 1. 26. 8. But
compare also on P. ²4·
