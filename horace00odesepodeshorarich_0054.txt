18 HORACE

albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo 15
saepe Notus neque parturit imbris
perpetuos, sic tu sapiens finire memento
tristitiam vitaeque labores
molli, Plance, mero, seu te fulgentia signis
castra tenent seu densa tenebit πο
Tiburis umbra tui. Teucer Salamina patremque
cum fugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo
tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona,
sic tristis affatus amicos:
‘quo nos cumque feret melior fortuna parente, 25
ibimus, o socii comitesque!

uda Ι ...rivist for the grouping see on P. 9. Note the happy juxtaposition
uda mobilz'bus—waters rushing. Wickham sees a reference to water—mins.

15, 16. albus ut obscuro deterget...caelo Ι ...Notus: for the grouping
see on P. 8. Romans love such antitheses as albus obscuro (compare on Odes
1. 6. 9). See too Page on the emphasis of albus.

16. saepe (pps) equals πολλάκις μὲν οὐκ ἀεὶ δέ, and prepares us for the
emphatic perpetuos of l. 17.
Notus comes late in contrast to tu of l. 17.

17. perpetuos (pps) is emphatic by position: it stands alone at the com-
mencement of the line (see on Odes 4. 9. 26).

18. tristitiam vitaeque labores: if we put no stop at tristitiam, then vitae
may be in coniunctio position with the nouns. Others put a stop at tristitiam
(which then has emphasis; see Odes 4. 9. 26) and take molli as the impera·
tive of mollire ; in that case vitae labores will equal ‘life and its toils' (see
P. 38).

19. molli‚ isan adjective, is preposited and separated, and equals ‘mellow‚

not harsh'; but also see P. 27. For the separation by the vocative compare
on odes 1. 5. 3.

te: for its position see P. 51.

20, 21. densa... Ι Tiburis umbra tui: for the grouping see Ρ. 17.

Teucer Salamina patremque: see on Odes 1. 2. ¹7·

23. populea (ps): although he had been engaged in conviviality (the
worship of Bacchus), he put on not the vine leafor ivy‚ but the poplar leaf os
Hercules the wanderer.

24. tristis (ps) is predicative and means ‘because sad'3 he wishes to
encourage them.

25. nos: for position see on P. 51.

cumque: compare on Odes 1. 6. 3.

melior fortuna parente: the position of parente (outside melior and for-

tuna) is a bitter afterthought (see on P. 53) i.e. ‘fortune kinder—than my
sire.> Compare Odes 1. 15. 28, and see P. 49.
