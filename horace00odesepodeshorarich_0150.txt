fas et beatae coniugis additum
stellis honorem tectaque Penthei
disiecta non leni ruina, 15
Thracis et exitium Lycurgi.

tu flectis amnes, tu mare barbarum,
tu separatis uvidus in iugis
nodo coerces viperino
Bistonidum sine fraude crinis. πο

tu, cum parentis regna per arduum
cohors Gigantum scanderet impia,
Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
unguibus horribilique mala,

10. vini (p). . .lactis (ps) : these are the antithetical parts of the description3
hence the position of the words. Greek would write τοῦ μὲν οἵνου...τοῦ δέ
γάλακτος.

10, 11. lactis et uberes Ι rivos: see on P. 43.

uberes (βε) i.e. ‘the richness (of streams)'; see on Ρ. 27 and also on P. 21.

11, 12. truncis Ι lapsa cavis...mella: for the grouping see on P. 14.

13. beatae (p) i.e. ‘the apotheosis (of the wife)'; see on Ρ. 27.

coniugis (p) is the primary logical object <see on P. 38). Moreover a
complement stellis already stands between additum and lzonorenm hence the
second complement beatae coniugis may lie outside (see on P. 48).

15. non leni ruina: for the position of these words see on P. 48.

non leni (p): see on P. 29.

16. Thracis et exitium Lycurgi: for the grouping see on P. 20 β.

18. tu...iugis: for the grouping see on Ρ. 14.

19. viperino (s): one does not see a snake used as a hair—ribbon every
day; compare on aureo l. 29 below. See also P. 21.

20. Bistonidum (ps) i.e. ‘the Bistonides (on their locks)²; see P. 38. The
genitive seems to depend on both fraude and crinis. The order does not
favour taking sinesraude with the subject of coerces.

21, 22. parentis (p) is brought sorward next to tu in order to group the
topics together viz. ‘you, your father, and his realm? See on Oa'cs 1. 2. 17.

per arduum: the phrase is felt ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with regna, cohors, and
scanderet.

22. cohors...impia: sor the grouping and intrusive verb see on P. 46 a.

23. leonis (p): the order emphasizes his miraculous aspect.

24. horribili (p): the adjective may go with mgr-uibus also (see on P. 33);
but compare too Odcs 2. ¹4- 23.

25-28. quamquam is usually taken as ‘and yet' ; but it might well go with
dictus (καίπερ δοκῶν) i.e. ‘Though called more fitted sor the ‹lance...y0u were
accounted ill suited to battle ; but you were the sanie (scd idem is surely more
