168 HORACE

defunctumque laboribus ¹5
aequali recreat sorte vicarius
illic matre carentibus
privignis mulier temperat innocens,
nec dotata regit virum
coniux nec nitido fidit adultero. 20
dos est magna parentium
virtus et metuens alterius viri
certo foedere castitas,
et peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.
o quisquis volet impias ²5
caedes et rabiem tollere civicam,
si quaeret ‘pater urbium’
subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat
refrenare licentiam,
clarus postgenitis: quatenus, heu nefas} 30

14. longior annua is a restrictive addendum (see on P. 53)—‘that is
tillage beyond a year's space.'

16. aequali (ps): this is the important word, like aequo in aequo animo,
and therefore comes early. See also on P. 21.

17, 18. matre carentibus is a compound, ἀμήτωρ, ‘motherless’ Hence
matre need not lie between carentibus and prz'vzgrnis (see Odes 3. 1. 24). The
preposited position of matre-carentibus may make it (1) concessive, (2) causal,
but the latter sounds too much like Christian ethiCS.

innocens goes with temperat, ancl may surely mean ‘controls without
causing them hurt.' Horace uses innocens in one other passage only (Odes
1. 17. 21), where it has the same meaning. This is also Gow's view. See too
P. 31.

19. dotata (ps) i.e. ‘because she has a dowry.'

20. coniux probably has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘a true helpmate,
con-iuncta)

nitido (ps) i.e. ‘the sleekness (of a lover)'; see on P. 27 and P. 21.

21. parentium is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with dos and virtus i.e. ‘the dowry from the
parents is the parents' virtus?

22. virtus has emphasis (see on odes 4. 9. 26); their great dower is not
money but virtus.

23. certo (p) i.e. not lax but trustworthy.

25, 26. impias (p) equals contra pietatem, unpatriotic (with reference to
civil war), and prepares us for the stress on civicam (s)=1'2zter cives. For this
use of impius compare Odcs 2. 1. 30. See too on Odes 2. 14. 2 3.

28. indomitam (ps) i.e. ‘though untamed.'

30. clarus postgenitis is an addendum of result (see on l’. 53), ὥστε
