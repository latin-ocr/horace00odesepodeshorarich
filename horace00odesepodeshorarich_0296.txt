258 HORACE

fomenta vulnus nil malum levantia,
desinet imparibus certare summotus pudor.'
ubi haec severus te palam laudaveram,
iussus abire domum ferebar incerto pede 20
ad non amicos heu mihi postis et heu
limina clura, quibus lumbos et infregi latus.
nunc gloriantis quamlibet mulierculam
vincere mollitia amor Lycisci me tenet;
unde expedire non amicorum queant ²5
libera consilia nec contumeliae graves,
sed alius ardor aut puellae candidae
aut teretis pueri longam renodantis comam.

16, 17. haec ingrata may be a loose neuter plural ‘these wretched things';
the words fomenta vulnus m'l malum levantia then form an emphatic
addendum (see on P. 53), more closely defining lzaec ingrata i.e. ‘wretched
things which are like dressings that sting without relieving the wound.' See
Gow ad loc.

17. nil (s) and malum (s) have stress: the dressings do no good because
the wound is severe.

18. desinet is more vivid than desinam the protasis is a remote possibility,
the result is certain. Compare Odes 3. 3. 8 illabatur...ferz'ent.

summotus: may the metaphor be from a person ‘moved on’ hythe lictors,
with whom he has ceased to struggle, submitting to force majeure? He will
not fight the ‘low' (imparibus) policernen. Horace seems to imply that it is
a struggle between honour (pudor) and monied vulgarity (imparibus). But
see Wickham and Gow.

19. te palam: these words are in ιῖπὸ κοινοῦ position with severus and
laudaveram.

20, 21. domurn is first felt with both abire and ferebam then comes
incerto (p) pede, and we are not surprised to find that domum has changed
to the dwelling of his love. For this inevitable change the stress on incerto (p)
has prepared us. Horace here makes very elever use of order.

non amicos (ps): see on P. 29.

22. lumbos et infregi latus: for the position of infregi see on Odcs 1.
30. 6.

23, 24. , gloriantis...amor Lycisci: for the grouping see on P. 20 β.

25. amicorum (ps) is the real subject3 see on P. 38.

26. libera...graves: note the chiastic order of the adjectives.

27, 28. candidae Ι aut teretis: again note the chiastic order of the adjec-
tives.

28. pueri longam renodantis comam: the grouping may be that of P. 14.
But teretis hueri...ren0dantis may be classed under Ι). 34, and longam reno-
dantis comam under P. 21.
