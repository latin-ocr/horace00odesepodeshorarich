138 HORACE

sed iussa coram non sine conscio
surgit marito, seu vocat institor 30
seu navis Hispanae magister,
dedecorum pretiosus emptor.

non his iuventus orta parentibus
infecit aequor sanguine Punico
Pyrrhumque et ingentem cecidit 35
Antiochum Hannibalemque dirum3

sed rusticorum mascula militum
proles, Sabellis docta ligonibus
versare glaebas et severae
matris ad arbitrium recisos 40

portare fustis, sol ubi montium
mutaret umbras et iuga demeret
bobus fatigatis, amicum
tempus agens abeunte curru.

29. coram is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with iussa and surgit.

30. marito comes last with emphasis3 even her husband is party to it.

31. navis (p) at once suggests sailor in contrast to the land-lubber institor.

32. dedecorum has emphasis since it stands outside pretiosus emptor (see
on P. 43); the captain is canny enough and close-fisted enough in buying
from natives. but he is positively extravagant in buying a woman’s dz'slzonour.

33. non his (s) has emphasis i.e. ‘not like thesea&

35, 36. ingentem (s): the adjective is almost titulat, like ‘Alexander the

ingentem . . . A ntioclzum Hannibalem. . . dirum.

37, 38. rusticorum...proles: for the grouping see on P. 9.

proles: there is no real pause here; the word is read straight on with
sabellis docta etc.‚ and we need not include it among the examples cited at
odes 4. 9. 26.

Sabellis (ps) may mean ‘among the Sabines’ (see on Odes 1. 33. 16); it
can also colour both proles and legonibus (see on P. 52). For the grouping
Sabellis docta &sonibus see Ρ. 24.

39. severae (p): a mother is not usually severa to her boys. See on
Odes 3. 1. 47.

40, 41. matris (p): they obeyed their mother, not their father only.

recisos portare i.e. ‘to cut and carry’ ; see on Epml. 5. 32.

41—44. Most commentators appear to assume that the time is evening.
It is surely possible that the hour of siesta is meant. The early position of
sol seems to suggest the hot sun. We are in a deep mountain valley; the
topic is the sun and the mountains (sol...montt'tmt; see on Odes 1. 2. 17); the
