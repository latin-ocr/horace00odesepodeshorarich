158 HORACE

annosa cornix, dum potes, aridum
compone lignum: cras Genium mero
curabis et porco bimenstri 15
cum famulis operum solutis.

XVIII.

Faune‚ Nympharum fugientum amator,
per meos finis et aprica rura
lenis incedas abeasque parvis

aequus alumnis,

si tener pleno cadit haedus anno, 5
larga nec desunt Veneris sodali
vina craterae, vetus ara multo

fumat odore.

litus: the position of this word, like that of nemus between foliis and
multis, makes a vivid picture of a shore covered with seaweed3 see the note
at Odes 4. 8. 33. Latin love of parallelism may also be at work; aftersolz'z's
nemus multis it was inevitable to write alga litus inutili. Compare Odes
3. 25. 11, 12.

11. demissa (p) i.e. ‘the downrush (of the storm)’; see on P. 26.

ab Euro by its position outside demissa and tempestas ought to have
emphasis. Compare Odes 4. 6. 10, P. 34 adfin.‚ and P. 49.

12. sternet: there is little point in its position (see on odes 4. 9. 26).

aquae (ps): the cornix is augur of rain, if of nothing else.

13. annosa (p) i.e. with all his years of experience he ought to know
something about the weather.

aridum (ps) i.e. before it is drenched with the rain. See too P. 21.

15. curabis: its position (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) may be justified because it
is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with mero and porco (compare Odes 2. 5. 2, 2. . 14, 2. 16. 22,
3. ¹9- 3, 3. 20. 13, 3. 24. 11, 3. 24. 38, 3. 27. 2, 4. 6. 3).

16. eum famulis...solutis is an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53) and a
last hit, perhaps, at one who, claiming high lineage, sits more maior-mn with
farm-hands in the kitchen.

XVIII. 1. Faune...amator: sor the grouping see on P. 16, adfin.

2. meos (p) i.e. whatever you do to others—selfish, but very Roman!

aprica·(p): the epithet ‘sunny' implies the golden grain and verdure of
the meadoxv3 these Faunus might ruin by his tread. So Epist. 1. 14. 30 aprico
(ps), where the flood may wash away the produce.

3. lenis equals an adverb3 see on P. 32.

incedas abeasque: note the juxtaposition of the verbs i.e. if you do come,
go quickly.

parvis (s) has emotional emphasis i.e. ‘poor little things l' See also Ρ. 24.
