EPODE 2 237

labuntur altis interim ripis aquae, ‚3
queruntur in silvis aves.
fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
somnos quod invitet levis.
at cum tonantis annus hibernus Iovis
imbres nivesque comparat. ³0
aut trudit acris hinc et hinc multa cane
apros in obstantis plagas,
aut amite levi rara tendit retia
turdis edacibus dolos,

24. tenaci (p) i.e. ‘the thickness, deep-rootedness (of the grass)'; see on

ι Ρ. 27.

25. alti: interim ripis (v. l. rivi-0: the context seems decisively in favour
of n‘puh. We are talking of summer (contrast 1. 29) and therefore the stream
is low and the banks are deep. The adverb ought to go, by position, with

1 aleis and npis i.e. ‘between banks that are for a while steep,' i.e. during the

summer months. Horace has interim elsewhere once only viz. odes 3. 2o. 9,
where it bears its ordinary sense interea. Quintilian is quoted as using
bumm- for a while,’ and we may be permitted to assume this meaning here.
For the position of the adverb compare Livy 1. ¹9- 4, ι. 21. 6 and passm. lf
interm is taken with labunturi. e. ‘while one sleeps: the order is very abnorrnal
(see P. 50 e).

27. fonte· (Markland frondes). whichever we read, the stress on manan-

2 tibus remains i-e. ‘the fountains murmur with flowing (not ruentibus) waters,'

or ‘the leaves rustle in chorus with the flowing waters.‘ lf the waters did

⁴ more than manare, the leaves would not be heard, and one could hardly

810⁸}- levin (s): contrast grmn's (hoevy and unhealthy). Compare Odes

¹ 2:615.

29· tonantis-..levin for the grouping see on P. ις.
31. teria is proleptic with trudit i.e. ‘drives into wildness'; like our

⁹ colloquial ‘drives him wild.' See on P. 30.

32. obstantia (p) i.e. ‘into the obstacle (formed by nets).’ See on Odes
3. 5. 5¹ and P. 26.

33- amite: as we do not know the quantity of the a, we do not know, with
certainty, the quantity of the c in levi.

ran (μιῆς see on P. 21. The meaning of rara is doubtful. Wickham says
‘wide-meshedss a sense which would suit a net for catching boars and decr,
but hardly a net for catching thrushes. Perhaps the word means no more
than ‘full of holes’ (compare Ovid Met. 12. 437 rari sub pondere cribri), and
has grown into a stock epithet of nets. See Conington on Aen. 4. ¹3¹· One
would expect rara to mean ‘fine-meshed' in contrast to the densae plagae for
catching deer (see Odes 3. 5. 3¹· 32).
