EPODE 1 7 ²73

Neptunus alto tundit hibernus salo. 3,
inultus ut tu riseris Cotyttia

vulgata, sacrum liberi Cupidinis,

et Esquilini pontifex venefici

impune ut urbem nomine impleris meo?

quid proderit ditasse Paelignas anus, ω
velociusve miscuisse toxicum?

sed tardiora fata te votis manent:

ingrata misem vita ducenda est in hoc,

novis ut usquc suppetas doloribus.

optat quietem Pelopis infidi pater ⁶³
egens benignae Tantalus semper dapis,

nn nudi· mrdiom navitis: for the grouping see P. 14.

55. uepmmn...ulo= for the grouping see P. ¹3·

56. imnum has stress because it precedes ut; compare t‘mpunel. 59 below.
See too ΕΜ 6 16.

57. vulgata bas some added interest by position (see on odes 4. 9. 26);
it is causa! ιε. ‘because you have divulged them)

liberi (p): contrast modesti.

58. quufflni pontifex vmefici: for the grouping see on P. 20 ο.

59. meo (s) i.e. ‘my name’ ; but see P. 21.

60. proderit: if this is read, Canidia professes that Horace intends
learning about potions in order to kin himself ; if we read proderat, then
Canidia is represented as asking ‘what was the use of learning about speedy
poiseus, if 1 let you go?

Paeligna, (p): the district was famous for witches3 compare 11. 28, 29 above
and see ΕΜ 5. 76.

61. velocius (ps): see on P. 28 and P. 21.

62. aed: a variant is si, which would require a question mark after manent
and a comma after toz-ntum 1. 61. .

tardiora (p): see on P. 28; the comparative has stress in contrast to
velocius of 1. 61.

votis: if the ablative is one of comparison, the word ought to lie between
tarcum and sata (see P. 49); it seems, however, possible to take votis as
causal ablative with lemmanent i.e. ‘a slow death awaits you because of your
imprecations against me)

63. minero goes first with ingrata, then with ducenda; compare l. 37 above,
and see P. 50 a.

64. novin (s) i-e. ‘unheard of‚’ *horrible’ ; see on Odes 1. 2. ὁ, and 2. ¹4. 23.

65. Pelopi! (p): the son's faithlessness is important as implying a similar
or worse characteristic in the father. As Wickham says, ‘Tantalus' character
is to be gathered from that of his son.' But see on Odes 1. 28. 7, and P. ⁴¹·

66. egena benigna Tantalus...dapia: for the grouping sce on P. 9.
