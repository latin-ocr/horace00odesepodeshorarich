174 HORACE
XXVII.

Impios parrae recinentis omen

ducat et praegnas canis aut ab agro

rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino
fetaque volpes,

rumpit et serpens iter institutum, 5
si per obliquum similis sagittae
terruit mannos. ego cui timebo

providus auspex,

antequam stantis repetat paludes
imbrium divina avis imminentum, 10
oscinem corvum prece suscitabo

solis ab ortu.

XXVII. 1, 2. Impios...omen Ι ducat: for the order see on P. 51.

parrae(p) i.e. ‘the owl (and its omen)'; see on P. 38. The position also
prepares us for canis, lupa, volpes.

2. ducat may be emphatic (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); the poet wishes that
the omen may not merely terrify for the moment, but attend the impios on
their way. See however on Odes 3. 17. 15.

praegnas (p>: ‘pregnancy (of the canz's)'; see on P. 27.

2, 3. ab agro-..Lanuvinoz for the grouping see on P. 18.

rava decurrens probably sounds like ‘a dun streak as it speeds down.’

4. feta (p): see on praegnas 1. 2 above.

6. per obliquum: sc. veniens or the like.

7. mannos: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

8. providus (β>; the ordinary auspex judges after the flight, but Horace
will arrange things beforehand. Before the divina avis can (repetat is sub-
junctive of purpose prevented) give warning of storm, he will prearrange on
the east, the propitious side if you turn north, the cry of a corvus.

9. stantis (ps): Horace, if a friend is to travel (timebo is future), will have
him go in summer, when the voyage to Greece would be safest. The running
waters are then dried up, and the divina avis (probably the cornix) seeks
‘standing waters’ in the marshes. There it utters its raucisonos cantus
(Lucretius 5. 1083), caput spargens undis, velut occupet imbrem (Lucretius
5. 556), and pluviam vocat...et sola...spatiatzcr (Vergil Georg. 1. 389). Cicero
Progn. 22 3 speaks of it as cursans per litora before a storm and adds demersit
caput et fluctum cervice recepit. But see also P. 21.

10. imbrium...imminentum: for the grouping see on P. 18.

11. oscinem (p): (ι) ‘the cry (of a comsus)'; see on P. 27; (2) proleptic
(so Wickham) ; compare on P. 30.

12. solis ab ortu: an emphatic addendum (see P. 53) and equals idque
solis ab opu, the favourable side (see on l. 8 above). Perhaps solis is pre-

τυ .
