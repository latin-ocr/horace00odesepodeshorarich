108 HORACE

dextra levasset, Mercurialium
custos virorum. reddere victimas 30
aedemque votivam memento:
nos humilem feriemus agnam.

XVIII.

Non ebur neque aureum
mea renidet in domo lacunar,

non trabes Hymettiae
premunt columnas ultima recisas

Africa, neque Attali 5
ignotus heres regiam occupavi,

nec Laconicas mihi
trahunt honestae purpuras clientae.

at fides et ingeni
benigna vena est, pauperemque dives ’ ιο

27. me is placed early in contrast to te of l. 22.

cerebro: for its position outside truncus and illapsus see on P. 47.

29, 30. Mercurialium Ι custos virorum: for the grouping see on P. 20 β.
With custos supply ὤν causal i.e. ‘because he is the guardian....' See note at
Odcs 2. 18. 14.

virorum is perhaps half comic, like our ‘gentlemen' in ‘gentlemen of the
road,' ‘gentlemen of the pen.'

τεᾱᾱετεεᾰποδιδόναι ‘to give what is due'; hence it comes early with
stress.

32. humilem (ps): contrast the expensive victima of l. 30, quae nivali
pascitur Algido (Odes 3. 2 3. 9). See also P. 21.

XVIII. This ode is apparently an experiment in metre; not always a
successful experiment, if one may judge by certain obscurities of expression
and abnormalities of construction.

1, 2. aureum...laeunar: for the grouping see on P. 8.

4, 5. columnas...Africa: for the grouping see on P. 14.

Africa should have stress3 see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

5, 6. Attali (p) belongs to regiam as well as to heres. Its position makes
it generic i.e. ‘an Attalus'3 compare Attalicis (p) at Oa’cs 1. 1. 125 and see
P. 37 adfin„ and P. 43.

ignotus (p) on the analogy of novus (p) lzomo.

7, 8. Laconicas (ps), because Laconian purple was one of the most
expensive purples. For the grouping Laconicas...honestae puppuras clt'entae
see on P. 9.

9, 10. at fides et ingeni Ι benigna vena est: a Roman would read these
words thus: ‘But loyalty and ability l have, and a rich vein of the latter!
