ODES n, 12 95

Saturni veteris: tuque pedestribus
dice· historiis proelia Caesaris, no
Maecenat melius ductaque per vias

regum colla minacium.

me dulcis dominae Musa Licymniae

cantus, me voluit dicere lucidum

fulgentis oculos et benc mutuis ¹3
fidum pectus amoribus;

quarn nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris
nec certare ioco nec darc bracchia
ludentem nitidis virginibus sacro
Dianae celebris die. 20

6. namne· (p): the adjective is like a preposited genitive equivalent to
‘iamed by Hercules by his hand'; see on P. 38, and compare the note at
Odes 1. 3. 36. For the grouping see also P. ιο.

8. {uim (ps->z the order suggests that fulgens is more than a mere epi·
thet of domus, and that it is a true participle i.e. ‘all ablaze there trembled...’ ;
but see P. 21, and Odes 3. 3. 10, and 3. 3. 33.

9. pedem-mu· (ps): contrast poetic-ln see also P. 21.

11, 12. melius (pps) has emphasis and equals idque melius.

ducta-..minacimm for the grouping see on P. ¹7-

13, ¹⁴· me is emphatic by position ; contrast tu of 1. 9.

dulei· (ps) ἰ.2. ‘the charms (of her singing)' ; 522 on P. 27, and contrast
serae and bella of 1. 1. Two points are to be noted ε (1) the position of Musa
between donn‘nae and Lr'cymm'ae3 (2) the stress on cantus (see on odes
4. 9. 26). The word cantus thus prepares us for the antithesis fulgentis oculos
andfidunr pectus. Horace is bidden to sing of Licymnia's music, flashing eye,
and fidelity. N ext, the group dominae Musa Licymniae ought. as Wickham
says, to mean ‘the Muse of your lady Licymnia’ (see for the grouping P. 200,
and compare Odes 2. 1. 9 severae Musa tragoediae). The expression ‘ Muse
of Licymnia’ is possible enough in Horace; it is implied at odes 1. 17. 13, ¹4
pistas mea et Musa, and Epist. 1. 19. 28 ’temperat Archilochi Musam pede
meula Sappho. The sense therefore may well be as follows: ‘The Muse of
Licymnia (for Licymnia composes her own songs) bids me sing of her poetry.
her eyes, and her faithful affection)

14, 15. lucidum Ι fulgentia is a quasi-compound i.e⁴ ‘brightly·gleaming’;
see on Odes 3. 1. 2⁴·

15. fulgentis (p) i.e- ‘the flash (of her eyes)’; see on P. 27.

’ 1 cannot mist a word of comment on this line. wilkins translates thus: · Mu-
euline Sappho noulds her muse by the measure of Archilochus-⁹ But if Latin order
means nything, we cannot vell separate the group Archilochi musam μά. May we
not render by ‘sappho keep· within control the muse of Archilochus while using the
mensure of Archiloehm’?
