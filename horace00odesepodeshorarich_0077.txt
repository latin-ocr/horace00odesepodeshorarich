ODES 1. 19-20 41

XX.

Vile potabis modicis Sabinum
cantharis, Graeca quod ego ipse tata
conditum levi, datus in theatro

cum tibi plausus,

care Maecenas equeS, ut paterni 5
fluminis ripae simul et iocosa
redderet laudes tibi Vaticani

montis imago.

iz all to the point—a slauglaeered victim is what Venus wants, not one quae
&ascitur (Odes 3. 23. 9).

The ablative hostia perhaps confirms the view that hostia is also ablative
at odes 3. 23. 18.

xx. 1. Vile...modiei⁸ Sabinum Ι cantharis: sor the grouping see on
P. 9. Both Vile and potabis have interest ke. ‘cheap stufl' you shall swill‘:
indeed potahis might be contrasted with the more elegent bibes os 1. ιο.
Compare Cicero Phil. 2. 27. 67 totos dies potabatur (Le. ‘there was heavy
drinking all day') and the familiar potus et exlex.

The first three words Vile potabis modicis give us the picture ‘cheap wine,
swillfflg. and from cheap (cups).'

2. muman· has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); canthari are large, wide-
bellica, and have handles. The implied antithesis is the less clumsy poculum
os Ι. 12 below. For the grouping modicis· Sabinum Ι cantharis see note at
Odes 4. 8. 33.

Graec· (μὴτ another abomination—something Greek! Happily it is only
the whifl· os an empty jar. The bias of patriotism put Greek wines behind all
Italian vines, although Pliny esteemed them. Compare on Odes 3. 24 57.

3. datin in theatro· these words have stress because they precede cum.
Possibly then datus equals ultro dala-H Maecenas needed no claqueurs; and
in theatro draws attention to the public nature of the welcome.

5. care (p): the position, perhaps, emphasizes Horace' s affection3 but see
P. 36. Bentley's clare makes an excellent point. since clarus is used especially
of a senator, splendidus of a knight (see Duff on Juvenal Sat. ιο. 95). Thus
the sense would be ‘as glorious as a senator, Maecenas. though but a knight.’
See too on odes 2.17. 7, 8, 3. 24 30.

unani (pk Horace thus emphasizes the antiquity of Maecenas‘ family.
See Ode-r 1. 1. 1.

6. fluminis (p) Le. ‘the river (with its banks)’, · see on P. 38.

timul by position (⁴ cousunch‘o ’) belongs to both ripae and mantili· imago.

ἰοοωι (ps) equals an adverb ‘'zplaysully see on P. 31.

7. Vah’enni (p): the point is that even the more distant Vatican Hill
(more distant than the mons lam’culus) threw back the echo os such loud
applause. See on Odes 3. 29. 38, 39.

8., montis (p) Le. ‘the bill (and its echo)'; see on P. 38.
