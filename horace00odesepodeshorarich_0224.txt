1. The strained order of the Ode suggests that Horace was rusty after
some ten years' abstinence from writing this form of poetry.

1, 2. Intermissa...moves? If intermissa and diu belong to moves, we
must classify the grouping under P. 46 b, with the vocative Venus quasi-
parenthetic (see on Odes 1. 5. 3). Bentley says that to take intermissa and
diu with Venus is a puerilis error, but on grounds of order, at least, there is
no objection. We may compare Odes 3. 4. 26 versa acies retro and other
instances quoted at P. 49. It is just possible that intermissa is felt first with
Venus and subsequently with bella ( see on P. 52).

rursus (s) has emphasis; contrast intermissa-..diu (pps).

3, 4. bonae Ι sub regno Cinerae: for the grouping see on P. 20 a.

4, 5. dulcium...Cupidinum: for the grouping see on P. 15. Contrast
odes 1. 19. 1, and P. 36.

6. decern (pp) has emphasis.

mollibus (ps): contrast durum. As Gow says, mollibus is felt first with
flectere, then with durum.

8. blandae...preees: for the grouping with intrusive words see on P. 46 b.
The effect is to stress iuvenum, and to make blandae (ps) sound like blandi-
tiae (see on Ρ. 27).

9. tempestivius belongs to the whole sentence (see on Odes 2. 9. 13), but
also has stress by position.

10, 11. Pauli...Maximi: the extraordinary separation of Maximi from
Pauli has no real parallel in the odes, C. S.. or Rhodes, is we except the
dubious Raeti... Vindelici of Odes 4. 4. 17, 18, and 21‹›‘.-²‹z...Augusti tropaea
Caesaris at 2. 9. 18, 19, where the conventional order of P. 9 is illustrated.
In the C. S. l. 70 Horace writes quindecim Diana preces ‘f'l'r0r11m; but the
position of quindecim gives the effect of ‘llte XV' (in Ovid Ex Panto 3. 5. 23
