ODES ι, ι 7 37

hic in reducta valle Caniculae
vitabis aestus et fide Teia
dica laborantis in uno
Penelopen vitreamque Circen. ιο

hic innocentis pocula Lesbii
ducoe sub umbra, nec Semeleius
cum Marte confundet Thyoneus
proelia. nec metues protervum

suspecta Cyrum, nc male dispari η
incontinentis iniciat manus
et scindat haerentem coronam
crinibus immeritamque vestem.

17. reducta (p) i.e. because it is retired‚ sequestered. and therefore cool.

Caniculae (ps) i.e. the dog (and its heat); see on P. 38.

19. laborantis in uno: these words go closely with dices i.e. ‘will speak
os as lovesick sor one.’

20. vitream (p): the epithet suggests the immortal; thus Penelope,
the mor-tal, and Circe the goddess, are in love with the same man (ιή
uno).

21. innocentis (μὴτ even a lady may drink Lesbian without impropriety
and without headache; but sce P. 20 β.

22, 23. ωδ umbra is an emphatic addendum i.e. ‘ and in the cool shade';
see on P. 53.

Semeleius 1 cum Marte: sor case relations grouped early see odes ι. 2. ¹7-
Α Roman would read the words thus: ‘nor Semele’s son with Mars shall

Thyone„ goes closely with confundet i.e. ‘like the Son of Thunder
he is!

24. proelia has suess: see on odes 4. 9. 26.

24, 25. protervum (ps) equalsprotervitatem(Cyn'); see on P. 27. But sec
alno P. 24 and Ρ. 25. Observe that in the group protervum suspecta Cyrum
we may feel protervum...cyrum as equal to a proter-vo Cyro. and thus the
order is less startling (see on Epod. 7. 8).

mech i.e. ‘because suspected)

26. incontinentis(ps)equa1s incontinenter: see on P. 31 and P. 21.

27. hoctenem ( p): he has to tear ‘because the garland cleaves.'

28. crinibus would normally lie between haerentem and coronam, but
haerentem is a word which can hardly be absolute and we wait. without
difficulty. for the dative ς see on P. 47. The effect too of the order is ‘he tears
galanti, hair, and clothes!

humum is felt with both cn’m'bus and vestem: see on P. 3 3.
