ODES 1. 6-7 Ι7

sunt quibus unum opus est intactae Palladis urbem ,ς
carmine perpetuo celebrare et
undique decerptam fronti praeponere olivam;
plurimus in lunonis honorem
aptum dicet equis Argos ditisque Mycenas:
me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon ιο
nec tam Larisae percussit campus opimae
quam domus Albuneae resonantis
et praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus et uda
mobilibus pomaria rivis.

3, 4. vel Baccho Theba... Ι insignia: sor Baccho standing outside Thebas
and insignis, as Apolline outside Delphos and insigmis, see on P. 49. Horace
desires to bring out the artificia} antithesis os Bacchus and Apollo.

insignis may have stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

Theaua (p): there were many Tempe ς but the Thessalian vale was the
original and most famous.

5. intactae (p): the ritual and titular epithet is naturally stressed. Com-
pare Odes ¹- ¹9 3. s 4- ⁶4, 3 5- ¹¹· 3· 6· 35, 3-7- ¹8. 3- 29·64(?).4 4· 49.
4. 6. 28, ΕΜ 3. 17.

Palladis (p) urbem i.e. ‘ Pallas and her city'; see P. 38. There is also
implied the contrast os Bacchus and Apollo.

ὁ. celebrare et: for the position of et compare on Odes 1. 35. 39.

7. undique decerptam (ps): there seems to be some chiastic echo ofpcr—
petuo, and the words may suggest monotonous and prolix treatment. See
the commentatum, who compare Odes 1. 29. 13.

8. Iunonis(p): contrast Bacchus,Apollo,and Pallas; but see also on P. 42.

9. aptum (ps) is predicative i.e. ‘will sing of as aptum equis’; so ditis
(p)-‘(will sing of) as wealthy‚’ or ‘the wealth (of Mycenae).' Compare
claram in l. 1 above. Moreover Horace is quoting the stock epithets os
Homer (see Wickham) and wishes to draw our special attention to the worci-
ing os Grecian praise.

ιο. me comes early in contrast to alie· of l. 1 above. See also P. 51.

tam belongs to percussit and is emphatic by separation; the stress would.
in prose, be expressed by ‘ not hals so much.' Compare tam in the next line.

patiens (p) i.e. ‘the hardiness (of Sparta)'; see on P. 27.

n. Larisae (ps) equals ‘nor Larissa...,' as is it were subject, parallel to
Lacedaemon. See Ρ. 38.

Latine...cunpus opimae: this grouping may be classed under Ρ. ¹0
and που (q.v.); and moreover opimae may be felt with campus; see P. 52.
The adjective is again a translation (ἐριβῶλαξ).

¹2, 13. Albuneae resonantis Ι et praeceps Anio: observe the chiasmus.
Fussheripraeecaeps (p) equals ‘the falls of the Anio ’ at Tibur. See on P. 27
and the note at Odes 3. 29. 6.

13, 14. Tiburni (p) equals ‘Tiburnus and his grove'3 see P. 38.
