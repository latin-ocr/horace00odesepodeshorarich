aerias temptasse domos animoque rotundum ⁵
percurrisse polum morituro.

occidit et Pelopis genitor. conviva deorum.
Tithonusque remotus in auras

et lovis arcanis Minos admissus, habentque
Tartara Panthoiden iterum Orco 10

demissum, quamvis clipeo Troiana refixo
tempora testatus nihii ultra

nervos atque cutem morti concesserat atrae,
iudice te non sordidus auctor

naturae verique. sed omnis una manet nox ι,
et calcanda semel via leti.

ironical. The word is frequently used os a ritual gift, cp. Catullus 101. 3 and
8, and passim.

5. aerias (μὴτ ‘air' is the point. not damon see Ρ. 27 and P. 21.

animo may be in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position with tenfitasu and ptrcum'sse.

rotundum (ps) i.e. ‘the wheel (of the heavens)'; see on P. 27 and P. 21.

6. morituro separated from tibi and coming last has great emphasis.
Compare the preposited moriture os Odes 2. 3. 4, and inter-imm at odes 4. 7. 10.

7. occidit comes first to echo mon‘turo and to emphasize the moral that
all, even the greatest, must die. Compare odes 3. 8. 18.

Pelopia genitor, conviva deorum: there appears to be an artificial chias-
mus. But Pelopis is regularly preposited in Horace (see Odes 2. 13. 37 and
Epod. 17. 65). See however on Ρ. 41.

8. in auru: for the position of these words see on P. 47.

9. Iovis (p): Minos is not merely conviva deorum but confidant os great
Jove himself. obses-ve that Horace could have written arcanisque lovis had
he not wished to stress lm‘s.

lovis uanis Minos: sor case relations grouped early sec on Odes 1. 2. 17;
the topic is Jove's secrets and Minos. The separation of arcanis from admis-
sus gives arcanis stress: he is admitted non cem]- modo sed ettam arcanis
(see on P. 49).

11, 12. danim has some stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); contrast remotus
in auras of l. 8.

clipeo Troiana refixo Ι tempora: for the grouping see on P. 14. Α Roman
could, l fancy, feel Troiana with cirpea as well as with temporem see on Ρ. 52.

13. atne (s): see on P. 21. The effect is ‘to death and darkness!

14. non eordidus(p): see on P. 29. ln litotes we have, in effect, a stressed
preposited epithet-

15. mm verique: for the position os these words see on P. 3 3.

omnin: for its position see on P. 51.

una (s) is brought close to omnis·; this is a {avom-ite collocation (compare
Qdes 3. 4. 48). See however the next note.
