246 HORACE

Nox et Diana, quae silentium regis,
arcana cum fiunt sacra,
nunc, nunc adeste, nunc in hostilis domos
iram atque numen vertite.
formidulosis curn latent silvis ferae 55
dulci sopore languidae,
senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum
latrent Suburanae canes,
nardo perunctum, quale non perfectius
meae laborarint manus. 60
quid accidit? cur dira barbarae minus
venena Medeae valent,
quibus superbam fugit ulta paelicem,
magni Creontis filiam,
cum palla, tabo munus imbutum, novam 65
incendio nuptam abstulit?

52. arcana (ps): secret rites require the patronage of N ight. Compare
1. 55 below for the grouping.

53. hostilis (p): see on P. 37, and note at odes 2. 12. 22.

55, 56. formidulosis (ps): the stress again adds to the horror (compare
ll. 47, and 52). For the grouping compare arcana cum fiunt sacra at 1. 52 above.

ferae...languidae: for the grouping see on P. 18. In any case dulci sopore
would lie between ferae and languidae. Perhaps serae and dulci are purposely
set together for the sake of the antithesis.

57. senem is separated from adulterum to bring out the point—the
comicality of an old man playing Don Juan.

58, 59. Suburanae (p): the dogs of a low quarter bark at and betray a
‘swell' who is nardo perunctus. The words nardo perunctum come as a sur-
prise, as an emphatic addendum3 see on P. 53.

60. meae (p) i.e. αἵ γε ἐμαί, whatever other hands have done. See too
P. 21.

61, 62. dira barbarae...venena Medeae: sor the grouping see on P. 9.

minus has emphasis by separation from valent.

63. superbam (p) i.e. ‘the haughtiness (of her rival)'; see on P. 27. There
is a variant reading superba.

64. Creontis (p): see on P. 41.

65, 66. tabo would normally lie between museus and imbulum ; the words
palla tabo make us expect imbuta, but the intervening munus changes imbuta
to imbutum (see on P. 49).

novam here approaches the sense os recentem (see on Odes 1. 31. 2, 3).
Juvenal Sat. 2. 120 also has nova nupta. After all, a recently wedded bride
has also ‘never existed before' (nova), so far as regards her husband. The
