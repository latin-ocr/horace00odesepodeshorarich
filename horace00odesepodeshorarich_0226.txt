188 HORACE

Albanos prope te lacus

ponet marmoream sub trabe citrea. 20
illic plurima naribus
duces tura, lyraeque et Berecyntiae
delectabere tibiae
mixtis carminibus non sine fistula;
illic bis pueri die 25
numen cum teneris virginibus tuum Ἴ
laudantes pede candido
in morem Salium ter quatient humum.
me nec femina nec puer
iam nec spes animi credula mutui 30

largi muneribus riserit aemuli: for the grouping see on P. 20 α.

muneribus may first be read as ablative of comparison with potentior, but,
when riserit is reached, the order is all in favour of taking it as causal
ablative.

19, 20. Albanos prope te lacus Ι ponet marmoream: the order, at first
sight, is extremely harsh. As, however, prope may follow its case, we really
have the grouping prope Albanos te lacus-...marmoream sor which compare
on P. 17. See also Odes 4. 15. 24.

sub trabe citrea is, perhaps, an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53) i.e. you
shall have a temple and that with a roof of expensive wood.

21. plurima (s) equals an adverb e.g. largissime, ἀφθονώτατα. See on
P. 31.

22. tura: forits position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

22, 23. lyrae (ps) i.e. ‘the lyre (and its music)'; see on P. 38 and P. 43.
For the abnormal order compare on Odes 1. 1. 23 lituo tubae Ι permixtus
sonitus. The genitive may, however, be pendent i.e. ‘and as for the lyre...
you shall be gladdened by the mingled music' (see on P. 40). But the
ablatives lyra...Berecyntia...tibz‘a have good MS authority. Others take lyrae
as dative.

Berecyntiae (ps): see on Odes 1. 18. 13 and 3. 19. 18. Compare too on
P. 21.

25. bis pueri die: perhaps both bis and die have streSS, the former by
separation from laudantes, the latter by separation from bis. The meaning of
bis is, I presume, ‘morning and evening‚' in honour of Venus as a morning
and evening star. The stress on die may be intended to einphasize the idea
that these pure children had no part in midnight orgies.

26. numen cum teneris virginibus tuum: the grouping may be that of
P. 18. But see too Ρ. 5ο c.

teneris (p) adds to the sensuous picturc; see too odes 1. 21. 1.

28. humum: sor its position see on &des 1. 3. 16.

29. me comes early in contrast to illic of l. 25.
