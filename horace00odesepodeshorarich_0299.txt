et decet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus. ⁵
tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo,
cetera mitte loqui: deus haec sortasse benigna
reducet in sedem vice. nunc et Achaemenio
perfundi nardo iuvat et fide Cyllenea
levare diris pectora sollicitudinibus, ιο
nobilis ut grandi cecinit Centaurus alumno:
‘invicte mortalis dea nate puer Thetide.
te manet Assaraci tellus, quam frigida ravi
findunt Scamandri flumina, lubricus et Simois.
unde tibi reditum certo subtemine Parcae ις,

rupere, nec mater domum caerula te revehet.
illic omne malum vino cantuque levato,

deformis aegrimoniae dulcibus alloquiis.'

4. de die is put late with emphasis i.e. ‘ere evening comcs’ (Wickham).

5. obducta (ps) i.e. ‘from the frown (on its brow)'; see on P. 26, and also

odas 2. 14. 23.

11. nobilis...alumno: for the grouping see on Ρ. 7.

12. invicte mortalis dea nate puer Thetide: perhaps it is best to puta
comma after mortalis, and to regard invni-te and dea nate as preposited ad·
jectives with vocatives (see on P. 36); then Thetide comes last as if we had

ἱ ἄίνὶκαιριιεν Thetidis (see on P. 20 5).

13. oemnet...tellus: see on P. 51.
Auunci (p): the more important word comes first (see on P. 38); not
