ODES 1, 3-4 1 3

nunc et in umbrosis Fauno decet immolare lucis.
seu poscat agna sive malit haedo.

pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum taberna-1
regumque turris. o beate Sesti,

vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat incohare longam. 15
iam te premet nox fabulaeque manes

et domus exilis Plutonia: quo simul mearis,
11ἴο ι’ἓξηέ vini sortiere talis

nec tenerum Lycidan mirabere, quo calet iuventus
nunc omnis et mox virgines tepebunt. ιο

lo. terne quem ferunt: the position of ter-me may be due to careless
imitation of such idioms as are found at Odes 1. 8. 2. and 1. 38. 3. 111 Vergil
Aen. 6. 792 Augustus Caesar, Divi genus, aurea conda ί saecula qui rursm
Latio the stress on aurea...saecula is clearly marked by the order. But such
familiar grouping as flore terris lato solutis (see P. 9) may have been in
,florace’s mind.

soluta is emphatic, i.e. only when earth has been freed from the chains
of the frost.

11. in umbrosis (ps): see P. 27. By this time the trees of the lucus
would have grown sufficiently to provide shade.

12. nvn is put after the verb to prepare us r'or the alternative haedo.

¹3· pauida (p): perhaps on the analogy of atra Cura3 see on Odes 2. ¹4· 23.

¹ aequo i.e. impartially; see note on 1. 7 above. See also P. 2¹.
pauperum (p) to prepare us for the preposited antithesis regum.

14. beate (p): see on P. 36.

15. vitae (p): the position maybe explained in several ways; vitae is the
important word and is practically subject (see P. 38); summa may have an
attribute on either side (see P. 35); it is possible that brevis is genitive with
vitae (see P. 20 β).

longum (s) is predicative and quasi-proleptic: we rough hew hopes of a
life that is to be long—rhu ι’λπίδα τείνειν μακράν.

16. te prexnet nox: for order see P. 51. But there is also stress on te:
Horace makes the application personal.

fabulae is a noun becoming an adjective and, as Page says, equals
’ fabulari (compare virgo charta, γέρων λόγος, virgin effort). Horace says ‘all
that is left for you is night, and the storied life of the dead, and the ghostly
world’; he intentionally throws doubt on it all by making fabulae prepositive.
Even such a world is doubtful (he cries); therefore eat, drink, and be merry.

18. talia: forits position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

19. tenerum (p): the delicate charm (of Lycidas); see on P. 27. The
epithet is proper to a woman; cp. Odes 1. 1. 26, and see Epod. 11. ⁴·

20. nime (pps): the position prepares us for the antithesis mox, which
itself is separated from tepebunt. See also on P. 50 b.

omnin (pp-r) is emphatic.
