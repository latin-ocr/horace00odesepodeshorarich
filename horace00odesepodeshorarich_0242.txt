204 HORACE

te multa prece, te prosequitur mero

defuso pateris, et Laribus tuum

miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris 35
et magni mernor Herculis

‘longas o utinam, dux bone, ferias
praestes Hesperiae!' dicimus integro
sicci mane die, dicimus uvidi,

the cultivation of the vine ; trees (notably elms) on which the vine was supported
have been viduae too long. See also Ρ. 21.

31. alteris (pa->2 the stress probably draws attention to the fact that the
farmer could now afford two courses. Libations were poured before the
mensae secundae.

32. te...deum i.e. ‘thee as a god.'

34. defuso pateris: for the position of pateris see on P. 47.

tuum (ps) echoes te...te of l. 33. See too P. 21.

(Gow); but see also on Odes 3. 17. 15.

Troiae...victor altae: for the grouping see on P. 20 a. There is stress on
Troiae.

altae (s) i.e. ‘for all its high towers'; compare Dardanas l. 7 below.

4. Phthius (mx perhaps in artificial contrast to Troiae. But see odes
