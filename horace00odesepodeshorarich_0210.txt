172 HORACE

exsomnis stupet Euhias,
Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam 10
Thracen ac pede barbaro
lustratam Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
ripas et vacuum nemus
mirari libet. o Naiadum potens
Baccharumque valentium ¹5
proceras manibus vertere fraxinos,
nil parvum aut humili modo,
nil mortale loquar. dulce periculum est,
o Lenaee, sequi deum
cingentem viridi tempora pampino. 20

XXVI.

Vixi puellis nuper idoneus
et militavi non- sine gloria:
nunc arma defunctumque bello
barbiton hic paries habebit,

9. exsomnis sc. οὖσα. Presumably the all—night festivals were held at the
full moon, when the country would be seen clearly enough, especially as the
plain is covered with snow. This does away with Bentley's obJ'ection that one
could not prospicere Hebrum at night.

10. nive candidam forms one word νιφαργής; hence nive need not lie
between candidam and Thracen (see on Odes 3. 1. 24). The preposited nive-
candidam equals ‘the snow-whiteness (of Thrace)’; see on Ρ. 27.

11. Thracen: its position (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) is, perhaps, in artificial
contrast to Rhodopen.

11, 12. pede...Rhodopen: the position of pede barbaro is abnormal (see
on P. 49), but Latin love of parallelism is doubtless the cause. Having written
nive candidam Thracen, Horace inevitably continued pede barbaro lustratam
Rhodopen (compare on Odes 3. 17. 10).

13. vacuum is in α’πο κοινοῦ position with mpas and nemus; see on

14, 15. Naiadum potens Baccharumque: for the grouping compare odes
3. 22. 1 montium custos nemorumque, and see on P. 34.

15, 16. valentium...fraxinos is a pointed addendum: Bacchus is lord of
worshippers with such wondrous powers; how miglity, therefore, must he
himself be l

proceras (ps) i.e. no inere saplings.

17. parvum (pp) and humili (p) have stress.

18. dulce (p) is predicative.
