ont-:s 11. 2ο ¹¹5

me Colchus et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis, Dacus et ultimi
noscent Geloni. me peritus

¹3. iarn goes with the whole sentence; see on odes 2. 9. 13.
Daedaleo notior Icaro: sor the grouping see on P. ²⁴ and compare Odes
4. ς. 11. ln any case Daedalus, the inventor, is to be stressed rather than

the unfortunate son.
14. tenentis litora Bosphori: sor the grouping see on P. 2ο β. At the
same time the mar ol' the breakers has point. Horace no longer fears them.

15. 16. Syrtisque Gaetulas...1-1yperboreosque campos: note the chiasmus

Ἰ of south and north.

canorus (p): the picture is os music in strange places and os wt'ngs (ales)
to take him there; hence canorus ales lies ἀπὸ κοινοῦ between Syrtis Gaetulas
and Hsperboreosqus campos.

17. me Colchus: case relations grouped early; see on Odes 1. 2. 17.

18. Manae (p): the Mai-sian mountaineers were among the finest fighters
in the Roman army.

ultimi (ps->2 a Roman would read thus: ‘men most distant will honour
me—the Geloni.' See too on P. 21.

¹9· peritus (ps->t contrast the barbarian Colchus and Dacus. See too on
P. 21.

20. Rhodani (p): contrast Hiberi (of the Ebro) implied in Hr'ber.

21. inani (p) i.e. ‘because the fimus is inane'; the coffin, so to speak, is

empty now that the body, magically changed. has flown away.

22. turpe· is probably ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with luctus and querimoniae.

23. sepulcri: the position sounds like ‘and as sor burial’; see on Odes
2. 8. 7, and P. 4ο. Let us have no burial (says Horace), for there is no body
to inter (Inani preposited l. 21), and let us have no honours, sor they are

superfluous (supervacuos preposited). ,
