BOOK III

Ι.

Odi profanum vulgus et arceo.
favete linguis! carmina non prius
audita Musarum sacerdos
virginibus puerisque canto.

regum timendorum in proprios greges, 5
reges in ipsos imperium est Iovis,
clari Giganteo triumpho,
cuncta supercilio moventis

est ut viro vir latius ordinet
arbusta sulcis, hic generosior 10
descendat in campum petitor,
moribus hic meliorque sama

1. 1. profanum (p) i.e. ‘the unhallowedness (of the vul‘grzfs)'; see on
P. 27. Note the ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position of vulgus between the two verbs.

3. Musarum (p) : contrast Iovis, Iunonis etc.

5. regum (ps): contrast Iovis l. 6.

in proprios greges might first be felt with timendorum (see on Odes
1. 35. 39, and 2. 2. 6) i.e. tyrants who spread sear over their subjects; later,-
of course, the phrase is governed by imperium, as in facile est imperium
z'n bonos (Plautus Miles 3. 1. 17). Compare also odes 4. 4. 2 regnum in
avzs.

proprios (p) i.e. their sway is limited (Wickharn).

6. Iovis comes last, contrast regum l. 5. ‚

7, 8. clari...moventi.s: these words are an emphatic addendum: see on
P. 53.

Giganteo (p) i.e. ‘because over giants’ ; but see P. 37.

10. sulcis has interest because the sentence is constructionally complete
at arbusta. Horace is thinking of a vineyard, on a large scale, where the
vines would be planted in long rows (sulcis) with uprights joined by a support
(see Shuckburgh on De Senect. 15. 52). Small holders would use no support
or trellis-work.

generosior sc. ὥν i.e. ‘because he is of nobler birth '3 the order prepares
us sor moribus and sama.

12. meliorque: sce on Odcs 1. 30. 6.

¹3- contendat has some stress (see on Odcs 4. 9. 26); even the man of .

character and repute still struggles and is the slave of ambition.
