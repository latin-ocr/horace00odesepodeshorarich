76 HORACE

redditum Cyri solio Phraaten
dissidens plebi numero beatorum
eximit virtus populumque salsis
dedocet uti 20

vocibus, regnum et diadema tutum

deferens uni propriamque laurum,

quisquis ingentis oculo irretorto
spectat acervos.

III.

Aequam memento rebus in arduis
servare mentem, non secus in bonis
ab insolenti temperatam
laetitia, moriture Delli,

seu maestus omni tempore vixeris, 5
seu te in remoto gramine per dies
festos reclinatum bearis
interiore nota Falerni.

17. Cyri (p) is in artificial antithesis to Phraaten. Phraates is a bad king
contrasted with the Xenophontic Cyrus.

18. dissidens plebi is causal, ‘because differing from the mob.’

19. falsis (ps) is purposely kept close to dedocet: Virtue can unteach only
what is false.

21. vocibus has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); words and phrases half
understood, catch-words, shibboleths are the bane of democracy.

22. deferens uni: the words lie in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position between diadema
tutum and propriam laurum.

propriam (ὣς the position emphasizes the idea of permanent possession.

23. ingentis (s) i.e. ‘however vast)

111. 1. Aequam(ps>: contrastardmkiealevelmind in uphillcircumstances.

2. mentem: see on Odes 1. 1. 14.

3. insolenti (ps) i.e. from a joy that is overdone. Greek would express
the emphasis on insolenti by making the adjective predicative‚ ἀφ’ ὑβριστικῆς
τῆς χαρᾶς. But see also on P. 24.

4. laetitia should have emphasis (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); perhaps the
purpose is to heighten the antithesis ofjoy and death (moriture).

moriture (p): see on P. 36, and compare Odes 1. 28. 6.

5—8. seu maestus...Falerni is an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53). See
also on Odes 2. 2. 3.

maestus comes early as if seu iucundus were following.

6, 7. te...reclinatum: observe how all the complements lie between tc
and reclz'mztzmz (see on Odes 1. 7. 29, and contrast P. 48).
