ODES 1. 11-12 25

arte materna rapidos morantem
fluminum lapsus celerisque vento-1. ,ο
blandum et auritas fidibus canoris

ducere quercus.

quid prius dicam solitis parentis

laudibu3‚ qui res hominum ac deorum,

qui mare et terras variisque mundum 13
temperat horis?

unde nil maius generatur ipso
nec viget quicquam simile aut secundum:
proximos illi tamen occupavit
Pallas honores, ιο

proeliis audax: neque te silebo.

Liber, et saevis inimica virgo

beluis, nec te, metuende certa
Phoebe sagitta.

9, ιο. rapidos (ps)...celeris ( p): both adjectives are emphatic i.e. ‘sor all
their speed’3 for the intrusive morantem see on P. 46 a.

11, 12. ιυτὶω...ςυε1·ωε; for the grouping see on P. 4611.

fidibus moris: these words go with both auritas and ducere i.e. oaks
with ears pricked up by reason of his tuneful strings he led by means of these
stnngs.

¹⁴· laudibus should have stress; see on Θεία 4. 9. 26.

15. variis (ps) is set purposely before mundum (κόσμος); the antithesis
is change and variety amidst law and order. See also on P. 27.

17. ἰριο is last with emphasis i.e. than the mighty master (ipse, αὐτός) of
it all.

19. proximos (ps) is put first to emphasize the antithesis secundum i.e.
there is no one in the race to be called secundus (following on the heels os ),
though there is somebody proximus (next), but only a very poor second.
See on l. 5¹ below.

21. proeliis audax: it is possible, with Bentley and others, to take these
words with Pallas, putting a comma, not full stop, aster Ιιυηονεςς they may
however go with both Pallas and Liber.

22. Liber should have stress; contrast Pallas. See on odes 4 9. 26.

22, 23. nevis...belui³: sor the grouping see on P. to. The antithetical
words are neatly grouped together: to the savage inimical, a maiden against
beasts. The stress on beluis is due to its position ; see on Odts 4. 9. 26.

23, 24. metuende...sagitta: for the grouping see on P. 9.

σει-ὴ (ps) i.e. ‘the sure aim (of his arrows)'; see on P. 27. ln the 0des,
epotus, and C.S. certus is never postposited.
