visam Britannos hospitibus feros
et laetum equino sanguine Concanum,
visam pharetratos Gelonos 33
et Scythicum inviolatus amnem.

vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
fessas cohortoe addidit oppidis,
finire quaerentem labores
Pierio recreatis antro. ,ο

vos lene consilium et datis et dato
gaudetis, almae. scimus ut impios
Titanas immanemque turbam
fulmine sustulerit caduco,

navita: the noun may be read as if navigans i.e. ‘sailing over,' as at
Aen. ι. 67 etc„ and its position prepares us for the antithesis viator l. 32
below.

3¹· temptabo: note the ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position os the verb governing both
Bosphorum and harenas.

urentia (p) i.e. ‘the beat (of sands)’; see on P. 27-

32. litoris Assyrii: the words are in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position with harenas and
mittor.

34 hemmmzcmcanum sor the grouping see on P. ιο.

equino has some suess: see on P. 37.

35. pharetratos (p) i.e. ‘the quivers (of the Geloni)’; see on P. 27. So
we might say ‘the assagais of the Zulus.’

3⁶· Scythicum (p) i.e. Scythia (and its river); see on Odes 1. 33. 16.

mmmm-uem the grouping is as if we had e! Scythicum visam
m Scythico inviolatus amne (compare on P. 2¹ and P. ²4)-

37, 38. vos Caesarem altmn, militia simul Ι fessas cohorte· addidit (Ρ)
wilh: this reading gives militia a position of emphasis as extreme as it is
poinuess 1 venture to think that we should accept sessus, omitting the comma
aster alcun, and take militia ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with altum and sessus i.e. ‘ raised to
fame bytvar bit-t weary of it.' Even is we read fessas, we may still take militia
with both altum and fissas.

P 4α Pierio (ps) i.e. ‘Pieria (and its cave)’; see on odes ι. 33. ¹6. See too
. 2¹.

41. lene (p) i.e. lene, non bellicosum.

42, 43. almae is causa} by position i.e. ‘because you are kindly, you rejoicc
in gentle counset’

impio· (p)...immanem (ωε the words os invective are naturally stresscd 2
see on Odes 2. ¹⁴· ²3-

44. caduco (s): see on P. τι. Horace seems to be translating καταιβάτης
κεραυνός.
