4 HORACE

dis miscent superis, me gelidum nemus 30
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori

secernunt populo, si neque tibias

Euterpe cohibet nec Polyhymnia

Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.

quodsi me lyricis vatibus inseres, 35
sublimi feriam sidera vertice.

II.

Iam satis terris nivis atque dirae

grandinis misit pater et rubente

dextera sacras iaculatus arces
terruit urbem,

me doctarum: the collocation makes a Roman read thus—‘ I am among
the poem, I, as poet, have the ivy, a poet’s reward.'

doctarum hederae praemia frontium: a pretty chiastic grouping3 com-
pare Odes 3. 9. 14 Thurini Calais filius Ornyti. If we look upon the
appositional praemia as equivalent to an adjective we have the grouping of
P. 15.

30. superis (s): perhaps=the gods of heaven above, i.e. the realm of
poetic fancy3 not the materialistic deos of l. 6, anthropomorphic‚ endowed
with human passions—pride and love of power. But see P. 21.

gelidum (p): the coolness (of the glade); see P. 27. The characteristic
feature of the nemus is coolness, for nemus properly means the small open
space in which the altar stood, surrounded by trees (lucus).

31. Nympharum: the word is logical subject and prepares us by its
position for the antithesis Satyrs. A Roman reads the line thus: ‘Nymphs
lightly with Satyrs dancing.' The Nymphs dance lightly though they have
awkward Satyrs for partners. Here there are two complements to leves...
chori, and one complement (Nympharum) is placed outside ; see P. 48.

32. populo: last, with some stress. Horace odz'tprqfanum volgus.

tibias, preceding the subject, prepares us for the chiastic barbiton. The
tibiae accompany choral odes; the barbitos accompanies songs sor a private
circle.

34. Lesboum (βε) the order recalls to mind the names os great lyrists
such as Alcaeus and Sappho. The stress is echoed in lyricis (p) of l. 35.

35. lyricis (p): if you rank me as a mere writer oflyrics (contrast an epic),
1 shall be more than satisfied.

36. sublimi (ps): contrast demisso. Horace means that instead of being
bowed down with shame because he cannot emulate the massive power os a
Vergil or a Homer, he lifts up his head alost in pride at being classed among
lyrists.

11. 1. satis...nivis: sor the separation of the partitive genitive compare
