ODES ιν, 13-14 221

quo sugit venus, heu, quove color? decens
quo motus? quid habes illius. illius,
quae spirabat amores,
quae me surpuerat mihi. ιο

felix post Cinaram notaque dotium
gratarum facies? sed Cinarae brevis
annos sata dederunt,
servatura diu parem

cornicis vetulae temporibus Lycen, ²3
possent ut iuvenes visere fervidi
multo non sine risu
dilapsam in cineres facem.

XIV.

Quae cura patrum quaeve Quiritium
plenis honorum muneribus tuas,
Auguste, virtutes in aevum
per titulos memoresque fastus

16. volucria (p) i.e. ‘the swift ssight (of time)'; see on P. 27.

17, 18. decena is probably felt with both color and motus; is it goes with
the latter only, then, being preposited. it means ‘the grace (of movement)’;
see on P. 27.

21, 22. nota...tncioe: dotium is Palmer’s emendation os et artium, in
which the et seems to mean ‘alsa’ The question whether seIt'x agrees with
Lyce or sacia is beyond settlement. 1f we read siu-ie (facies may be due to
dittography) one awkwardness disappearS.

brevia (p): conti-ast diu (pp) os 1. 2⁴-

24. servatum is concessive, ‘though they were going to preserve.¹

25. cornicis (p) i.e. ‘like the crow (with his long life)’; see on P. 38.

26. ponent ut: perhaps the position espossene sounds like ‘only to enable
young men....’ But see on odes 1. 37. 2ο. Horace could have written ut
possent and made the line scan.

fervidi (s): contrast ‘the cold, burm-out torch’ (Wickham).

27. mutto (s) has emphasis and equals plurimo.

mv. This is another laureate Ode. There is no caesura at l. 17 (com-
pare Odes 1. 37. t4—another laureate performance); and in 1. ⁴¹ no one can
honestly pause at'ter non.

2. tuas (ps) i.e. thy praises‚ whatever may be said of others. For the
intervening vocative see on Odes 1. 5. 3.

4. mernere· goes with both titulos and fastus ς see on P. 3 3.
