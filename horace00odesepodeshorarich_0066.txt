30 HORACE

aequor? non tibi sunt integra lintea,
non di, quos iterum pressa voces malo. 10
quamvis Pontica pinus,
silvae filia nobilis,

iactes et genus et nomen inutile,
nil pictis timidus navita puppibus
fidit. tu nisi ventis ¹5
debes ludibrium, cave.

nuper sollicitum quae mihi taedium,
nunc desiderium curaque non levis,
interfusa nitentis
vites aequora Cycladas. 20

XV.

Pastor cum traheret per freta navibus
Idaeis Helenen perfidus hospitam,
ingrato celeris obruit otio

ventos ut caneret fera

9. aequor should have stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26)—even though the
waters might be comparatively calm. See however Verg. Aen. 3. 157, and
Odes 3. 27. 23, and 4. 4. 54, where aequor is used of stormy seas.

integra is predicative.

10. pressa voces malo: it would seem that malo belongs to both pressa
and voces. With the latter it equals ‘in thy bitter hour’ (lit. by reason of
malum); but it cannot go with pressa alone, for then Horace could and would
have written pressa malo voces. Compare Odes 1. 23. 12 and Epod. 9. 31. It
is just possible that malo is dative3 cp. Odes 1. 2. 25.

11. Pontica (p): because it affords the best wood. Compare Noricus at
Odes 1. 16. 9.

12. silvae filia nobilis: for the grouping see on P. 20 Badfin.

14, 15. pictis...puppibus: for the grouping see on P. 10. The word pictis
is emphatic3 the sailor feels that the figure-heads on the stern are merely
painted idols; he is therefore frightened and puts no trust in them.

nil...fidit: there is stress on nil by separation, and on fidit by position
(see on Odes 4. 9. 26) 3 confidence is impossible.

17. sollicitum (ps) has emphasis: a taedium may be merely leve, like
levi exilio of Suetonius, Aug. 51. Compare the chiastic non levis of l. 18 (see
on P. 29).

19, 20. interfusa...Cycladas: for the grouping see on P. 7.

XV. 1. Pastor: by all rules of normal order pastor should be subject to
both traheret and obruit. It is true that plenty of cases may be quoted in
which the subject of the subordinate clause precedes the conjunction without
