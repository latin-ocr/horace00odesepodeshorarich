ODES t. 3⁴-35 ⁶3

mutare et insignem attenuat deus,
obscura promens: hinc apicem rapax
Fortuna cum stridore acuto ι ⁵
sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet.

XXXV. ς

0 diva, gratum quae regis Antium,
praesens vel imo tollere de gradu
mortale corpus vel superbos
vertere funeribus triumphos:

te pauper ambit sollicita prece 3
ruris colonus, te dominam aequoris
quicumque Bithyna lacessit
Carpathium pelagus carina:

Atlantem (p) merely equals ‘Atlas (at the boundary of the world)'; see
on Caluam, Odes t. 33. 16.

12. concinitur: for the emphasis see Odes 4. 9. 26; compare sustulit l. 16.

13. deu· coming last has stress. See also Odes 1. 3 ¹6.

¹⁴- obseura promum for the position os these words see on P. 5 3. The
stress enforces the antithesis ins-ignem attenuat.

rapax (p) is strongly verbal and may almost be felt to govern apt'cenr:
compare casm vitabundus, haec contionabundus and such Greek instance-s
as ὅπορο πόριμος. See also on Odes 3. 1. 16. Horace is thinking of Livy's
story at t. 3⁴- 8.

mv. ι. granam (ps): the adjective in sense and by position may.
perhaps, quality both diva and Antium (see P. 52). The diva is ‘gracious'
to Antium, and Antium is ‘pleasing’ to her (compare Odes 1. 30. 2 dilectam),
α’ ‘grateful’ for her protection (compare odes 3. 26. 9 where beatam diva
suggests ‘blessed in its goddess’). Π, however, we omit quae, the order is
that os P. 21. (Compare Odes 1. 38. ι.) Moreover gratum...Antium is equi-
valent to grati· regina Antii, for which see on P. 200.

2. imo (ps) has stress even without vel. See too P. 2ι.

3. 4. mortale (p) i-e. ‘even of mortal man.’

mbos: l cannot help feeling that a Roman would at first read superbos
as ‘the proud: «τοὺς ὑπερφρονοῦντας, and, in that case, the phrase is complete
atsnnen’bus (Le. ‘mdy to overturn the proud by means ossuma’); triumphos
therefore comes as an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53) i.e. ‘in the hour os
their triumph: and the juxtaposition ofsunm'bus is effective enough. lt is
hard to believe that vertere is not the antithesis attollere. W'ickham com—
pares AJ’. 226 and takes vertere to equal mutare.

ς. te m: note the case relations early. as in l. 9 below (see on Odes
ι. 2. ¹7)-
