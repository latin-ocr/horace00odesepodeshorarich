192 HORACE

concines maiore poeta plectro

Caesarem, quandoque trahet ferocis

per sacrum clivum merita decorus 35
fronde Sygambros:

quo nihil maius meliusve terris
fata donavere bonique divi
nec dabunt, quamvis redeant in aurum
tempora priscum. 40

concines laetosque dies et urbis

publicum ludum super impetrato

fortis Augusti reditu forumque
litibus orbum.

33. maiore (ps): the position is natural with comparatives ; see on P. 28.

poeta is qualified by the words between which it lies (see on Odes 3. 2. 32),
but maiore..plectr0 is heard with concines also.

34. Caesarem has sti-ess (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘Great Caesar'; the
position moreover prepares us for the antithesis of his doughty foes, the
Sygambri.

ferocis (ps) i.e. ‘for all their valour'3 the poet laureate wisely emphasizes
the valour of the enemy.

35. sacrum (p): the adjective comes first, usually, with clivus. Martial
1. 70. 5 has sacro veneranda petes Palatia clivo.

35, 36. merita (ps): the triumph was no formal compliment; Augustus
had conducted the campaign in person.

merita decorus Ι fronde: for the grouping see on P. 24.

38. fata...b0nique divi: the adjective may be ἀπὸ κοινοῦ (see on P. 33),
or may, as Page sayS, be emphatic i.e. ‘in their goodness.’

39. redeant comes early with emphasis i.e. ‘go back!

40. priscum (s>: the order echoes the stress on redeant i.e. ‘back to the
good old times.’ See also the note on Odes 3. 9. 17.

41, 42. laetos (p) i.e. ‘the gladness (of the days)’; see on P. 27.

dies et urbis Ι publicum ludum: the genitive urbis belongs to both dies and
[κάμπη hence its position (see P. 43). But urbis may be emphatic in contrast
to the rest of Italy.

publicum (p) is kept near to urbis and emphasizes the fact that the whole
populus was concerned. In Horace however, with one somewhat doubtful
exception (Odes 3. 24. 4), the adjective publicus is either preposited or
separated from its noun.

42, 43. impetrato Ι fortis Augusti reditu: the grouping may be classified
under P. 10; but both impetrato and forte} have interest. The former=‘ful-
filment of prayer (sor his return)’; see on P. 26. The latter is a compliment

stressed.
