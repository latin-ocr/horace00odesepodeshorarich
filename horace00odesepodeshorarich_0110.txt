74 HORACE

quis non Latino sanguine pinguior
campus sepulcris impia proelia 30
testatur auditumque Medis
Hesperiae sonitum ruinae?

qui gurges aut quae flumina lugubris
ignara belli? quod mare Dauniae
non decoloravere caedes? 35
quae caret ora cruore nostro?

sed ne relictis, Musa procax, iocis
Ceae retractes munera neniae,
mecum Dionaeo sub antro
quaere modos leviore plectro· 40

ΙΙ.

Nullus argento color est avaris

abdito terris, inimice lamnae

Crispe Sallusti, nisi temperato
splendeat usu.

29. quis non=omnis (s) emphatic.

Latino (p) anticipates impia in the next line. The blood is their own, shed
in civil war.

30. impia (p) echoes Latino above. Compare on Odes 3. 24. 25, and see
Odes 2. 14. 23.

32. Hesperiae (p) is set close to Medis with point3 the East hears with
joy of the fall of the VVest. But see also P. 20 a.

33, 34. lugubris Ι ignara belli: sor the grouping we may compare on
P. 2033 but lugubris (ps) can equal ‘the miseries <of war)’; see P. 27.

Dauniae (ps): the position makes it sound as if we had Daunii...caedibus;
see on Odes 1. 33. 16, and also on P. 21. 1 cannot see why the parspro loto
excuse should be dragged in. Horace is naturally proud of his own district.
The Italian state5‚ no doubt, still took pleasure in reininding Rome os the
debt which she still owed thein. A Scotch or Irish poet would do the Same
today.

36. quae caret ora: sor the separation ofquae and ora sec on Ozlcs 1. 27. 1 1.
The order helps to enforce the antithesis to mare 1. 34.

37. relictis, Musa...iocis: foi· the position of Alusa see on Odes 1. 10. 14.

Musa procax: see P. 36. Gow reads comma aster Alusa, not asterproccm:

38, 39. Ceae (fis) is kept close to facim the very word ceos suggests the
dirges of Simonides, and prepares us sor Dionaea (ps), which εῃ once calls
up to the mind the joys os love, since Dione was mother of Venus. But soi·
Ceae...muner‹c neniae see also 1). 20 (ι.

4ο. leviore plectro is an emphatic addenchnm see on P. 53.
