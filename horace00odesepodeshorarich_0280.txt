242 HORACE

ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium
liberrima indignatio? 10
‘sectus flagellis hic triumviralibus
praeconis ad fastidium
arat Falerni mille fundi iugera
et Appiam mannis terit
sedilibusque magnus in primis eques 15
Othone contempto sedet.
quid attinet tot ora navium gravi
rostrata duci pondere
contra latrones atque servilem manum,
hoc, hoc tribuno militum?’ 20

V.

‘At o deorum quicquid in caelo regit
terras et humanum genus,

8. trium ulnarum: for the position of the genitive see on P. 42.

9, 10. huc et huc may be α’πὸ κοινοῦ with vertat and euntium; but it is
more natural to take lzuc et lzuc with euntium. The group leuc et lucc euntium
is then ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ora and liberrima indzgrnatiQ hence it may stand out-
side these last two words (see on P. 43, and P. 49 with note there inserted on
Odes 1. 2. 23).

11. triumviralibus (s): the stress reminds us that he was flogged as a
slave by the triumviri capitales.

praeconis (ps) i.e. till even the praeco was tired of it; much more the
flagellator. The praeco was said to go on proclaiming the culprit's offences.

13. Falerni...iugera: for the grouping see on P. 9.

15. sedilibus...eques: for the grouping see on P. 14.

17, 18. ora...gravi Ι rostrata...pondere: for the grouping see on P. 14. But
gravi colours both navium and pondere (see on P. 52).

‘cot ora navium...rostrata: for the order see on P. 48.

19. servilem (p) echoes latrones, and has the same effect as servorum (p)
manum, where the genitive comes first because it is the more important word
<see on P. 38).

20. hoc, hoc...militum is a scornful and emphatic addendum5 see on
P. 53.

V. 1. deorum is preposited, as if we had 0 di qui...rqgritis. See also P. 38.
Wickham quotes Sat. 1. 6. 1. Horace rushes in medias res. See Dr Johnson
on ‘Ruin seize thee, ruthless king l' (Croker's Boswe11, p. 137).

2. humanum (p): as if Horace had written terras lzomim‘sqm'; see on
servilem Epod. 4. 19.
