Maecenas atavis edite regibus

o et praesidium et dulce decus meum :

sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum

collegisse iuvat metaque fervidis

evitata rotis palmaque nobilis g,
terrarum dominos evehit ad deos:

hunc, si mobilium turba Quiritium

In these notes (p) :preposite-d. (ἠπειρωτικὰ, (ps)= preposited and separated,
(γῇς postposited. (pps)=posiposited and separated. (P.)= prolegomena.

1. 1. regibus equals regiis (s); it is emphatic and predicative i.e. ‘sprung
from sorbears eluat were myas! Compare Odes 4. 5. 1 Divis orte bonis and
Cic. De Off 1. 32. 116 (ad fin.)obscuris orti mat'oribus. lt should be observed
that regibus edite would scan equally well. Horace, os course, may have
desired to avoid three final s’s in succession. See too P. ²4·

F or the intewemm see on odes 1. 5. 3.

2. dulce decus meum: decus stands between the two epithets. See

4, 5. metaque fervidis Ι evitata rotis: for the grouping see P. ¹4.

x ὁ. terrarum (p): lords of tlu's world, they feel that they are equals of the
heavenly beings (ad deos last). The order seems to support the view that

.ι marum dontius belongs to quos and not to deos. The stress on terrarum
υ is not appropriate to the gods; they are rather ‘lords os heaven’ as Catullus

calls them 68. 36. (76) caelestes pacificasset eros, or ‘lords of the universe‘ as
in Ovid Ex Ponto 2. 2. 12 in rerum dominos movimus arma deos (sor the
frequent position of rerum see P. 42). ln Ex Ponto 2. 8. 26 terrarum
dominun quent sua cura saci! Augustus is fittingly called ‘lord os this world,
'hile ib. 1. 9. 35, 36 nam tua non alio coluit penetralia ritu Ι terrarum
dominos quant colis ipse deos does not prove that terrm-um dominos refers to
deas, since the lines may mean ‘Celsus honoured you no less than you
honour these eanasy lords (especially the emperor) as if they were gods'
(note particularly l. 49 quem tu pro nunu'ne vivus habebas).
For evehit addeos compare Odes 4. 2. 17, and Juvenal 1. 38.
