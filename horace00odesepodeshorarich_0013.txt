INTRODUCTORY

HIS book is not a new commentary on part os Horace.

After the work done by Gow, Page, and Wickham (to men-
tion English commentators only) the gleanings are scarcely worth
publication except in fugitive articles.

What has been written hereaster is, as the title intimates, a
study in poetic order with illustrations from the Odes. C. S.. and
Epodes os Horace. Unless the order scemed to suggest that ac·
cepted versions might be reconsidered, 1 have, with very rare
exceptions, sorborne to comment at length. Thus this book is
intended to be used side by side with any edition os our poet; it
is neither a reclmuffd os previous editions nor, I hope, a collection
os notes spoilt in the borrowing.

Those who hold that almost any order may pass in poetry
will read my notes with impatience or something worse. 1 ask
them to suspend judgement and to await the cumulative effect
of the evidence. The rules os the game are simple enough. 1 make
no apologies sor repeating some os them. They were first clearly
stated by Professor J. P. Postgate. Attention to them, or rather

tiveness of Latin as a vehicle sor the expression os ideas. Here
are the five most important rules os normal order: (1) Adjectives, κ
except those os number and quantity. immediately follow the noun,
or, to use a brief terminology, are postpositive; (2) Genitives f
are postpositive3 (3) Demonstrative pronouns are prepositive;s
(4) Adverbs immediately precede the verb i.e. are prepositive; ,-
(5) ‘Subject...object...verb’ is the normal order. As everyone
knows, departure from these normal positions gives interest to
the word abnormally placed.

lt may be asked why the Romance languages do not show
survivals οἱ this system. They do show survivals, but not many.
One must remember that the introduction of Christianity caused
neglect of the classical models at a very early date. During the
