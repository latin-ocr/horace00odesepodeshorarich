ODES t. 16-17 ³5

hostile aratrum exercitus insolens.
compesce mentem! me quoque pectoris
temptavit in dulci iuventa
servor et in celeris iambos

misit furentem: nunc ego mitibus ²5
mutare quaero tristia, dum mihi
fias recantatis amica
opprobriis animumque reddas.

XVII.

Velox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam
defendit aestatem capellis
usque meis pluviosque ventos.

attis (p) i.e. with high citadel and therefore better protected.

ultimae (ps) has emphasis, like principi in l. ¹3 above ς see also
P. 21.

2ο. tunditis· (pp) is emphatic ; see also on odes 4. 9. 26.

2ι. hostile is preposited because aratrum is the emblem of peace; more-
over Horace always places hostilis· in front (see on Odes 2. 12. 22) and
usually makes generic adjectives preposited (see on P. 37).

22. me: forits order see on P. 51.

pectoris: a Roman might read this genitive as is‘ in my heart’ (compare
animi„ ultimately it goes with smtor.

23. dulci (p) i.e. ‘the sweetness, gladness (of youth)'; see on P. 27.

2⁴· celeria (p) i.e. too quick for me; they ran away with me.

25. mitibus is put early to prepare us for the antithesis tnlm'a, which is
placed last.

26, 27. mihi-..recantatisz mihi is felt with recantatis as though the latter
were a deponent in agreement with it. The construction is an extension of
the idiom noted at Odes ι. ιο. ¹4· Moreover she is amica in the atmosphere
os recanted libels; see on Odes 4. 8. 33.

xvn. ι, 2. velox amoenum...1.ucretilem Ι mutat...Faunus: for the
grouping see on P. ιο. The two adjectives (velox amoenum) make it ,
unnecessary to take saepe with amoenum Lucretilem only; see on P. 50 d.
The adverb goes with the whole sentence; see on Odes 2. 9. ¹3·

ignum (ps) i.e. ‘the fires (of summer)'; see on P. 27 and P. 21.

4. unque meis may be regarded as an emphatic addendum i.e. ‘and that
without ceasing and those goats mine’; see on P. 53. The pause at the end
οἱ l. 3 obviates the necessity of grouping capellis Ι usque meis tege-then sec
on P. 5⁰ b.

pluvios (p) i.e. ‘the rain (of, brought by, the winds)¹; see on l'. 27.
