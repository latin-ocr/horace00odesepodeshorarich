52 HORACE

quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis
magus venenis, quis poterit deus?
vix illigatum te triformi
Pegasus expediet Chimaera.

XXVIII.

Te maris et terrae numeroque carentis harenae
mensorem cohibent, Archyta,

pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum
munera, nec quicquam tibi prodest

21, 22. quis...Thessalis Ι magus venenis: for the grouping one may
compare P. 9. But Thessalis may be felt with both magus and venenis (see
on P. 52); moreover Thessalis magus venenis can be read as ‘a magician of
Thessalian charms' (see Odes 3. 2. 32). For the interest of Thessalis corn-
pare Marsis (ps) at Epod. 5. 76.

quis poterit deus: deus comes last as a climax—witch‚ magician‚ god.
But see also on l. 11 above.

23, 24. vix: for its position see note on non at Odes 2. 9. 13.

illigatum te triformi...Chimae1-a: what we hear in the first three words
is ‘a binding of you by a three-formed thing.' The word Chimaera comes
late so that triformi Chimaera may be heard with both z'llzgatum and expediet.
For similar constructions see on Odes Ι. 23. 12.

XXVIII. 1. Te...eohibent...munera: for the position of Te see on P. 513
but the pronoun is brought forward also to be parallel to me quoque of l. 21
below.

maris (p)...terrae (p)...harenae (p) are emphatic in contrast to pulveris
enguz' (ps). '

numeroque carentis (p): the point is ‘you, Archytas, thought in terms of
sea and land, and of z'nfinz'ty, but now a few grains are enough for you.’ The
two words numero carentis form a compound adjective ‘numberless‚ innumer-
able’3 otherwise normal order would require carentisque numero harenae.
See on Odes 3. 1. 24, and compare too on Odes 3. 26. 10.

2. cohibent: as Wickham sayS, the verb equals κατέχειν. Jebb on Anti-
gone 409 πᾶσαν κόνιν σήραντες ἢ κατεῖχε τὸν νέκυν translates κατεῖχε by
‘covercdss May not κατέχειν and cohibere signify ‘keep down‚' ‘prevent from
wandering’? ’

3, 4. pulveris exigui (ps): the words are the real subject i.e. ‘a little dust
(as a meagre gift)'; see on P. 38. The antithesis of maris...lerme is also in
mind.

exigui has stress; adjectives of number and quantity are normally pre-
posited.

litus...munera: sor the grouping see on P. 14. Is we read latum, compare
on P. 9. The juxtaposition of latum and parva is neat, even if artificial.

munera may have stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); perhaps the effect is
