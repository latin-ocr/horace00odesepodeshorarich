Inclusam Danaen turris aenea

robustaeque fores et vigilum canum

tristes excubiae munierant satis
nocturnis ab adulteris,

si non Acrisium virginis abditae 5
custodem pavidum Iuppiter et Venus
risissent: fore enim tutum iter et patens

converso in pretium deo,

aurum per medios ire satellites
et perrumpere amat saxa potentius 10
ictu fulmineo: concidit auguris

Argivi domus, ob lucrum

15. flos purpureus rosae: for ⁴the abnormal order see on P. 443 but
purpureus may colour both flos and rosae3 compare odes 1. 19. 1, and see
P. 52 ad fin.

16. vetulam: the interposition of this word in the normal group poti faece
tenus cadi gives it appropriate and most unpleasant emphasis ; the two words
poti vetulam at once bring up the picture of a drunken old beldame. But the
reading vetula (p) with faece has point3 because the wine is old, she drinks
it to the dregs.

XV 1. 1, 2. Inclusam Danaen turris aenea Ι robustaeque fores: note the
chiastic grouping of epithets and nouns.

Danaen turris: see on P. 51.

vigilum (p) has stress; contrast ⁶ somnolent.’

vigilum canum: the preposited genitive is the logical subject ; see on P. 38.

3. tristes (p) i.e. ‘the sternness‚ implacability (of their watch)’; see on
P. 27, and odes 2. 14. 23.

satis (pp) i.e. ‘ more than enough.'

4. nocturnis (ps) equals an adverb ‘at night'3 see on P. 31, and Odes
2. 13. 7.

5, 6. Acrisium is logical subject and is placed early to give υς, as soon as
possible, the other important person in the story.

6. pavidum: for the second complement outside see on P. 48.

7. risissent has stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

tutum is either predicative or its position is due to the fact that iter lies
ἀπὸ κοινοῦ between the two epithets. Compare Milton’s ‘in this dark world
and wide‚' and see too P. 34.

8. converso...deo is an emphatic proviso; see on P. 53, and also Odes
3. 1. 34.

9. medios (ps) i.e. ‘the very midst (ofgua1·ds)'; compare Ozlcs 3. 2. 12 etc.,
but see also P. 21.
