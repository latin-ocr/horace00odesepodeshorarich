200 HORACE

duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
nigrae feraci frondis in Algido,
per damna, per caedes, ab ipso
ducit opes animumque ferro. 60

non hydra secto corpore firmior
vinci dolentem crevit in Herculem,

monstrumve submisere Colchi

maius Echioniaeve Thebae.

merses profundo: pulchrior exsilit; 65
luctere: multa proruet integrum
curn laude victorem geretque
proelia coniugibus loquenda.

53. cremato (ps) fortis i.e. ‘brave in spite of the burning (of Ilium)'; see
on P. 26.

54. iactata...sacra: the familiar grouping of P. 1o suggests that iactata
agrees with sacra; if it agrees with gens, T uscis is preposited in contrast to
llio (l. 53), and we may compare Ausonias (p) of l. 56. Possibly iactata is
heard first with gens, then with sacra.

aequoribus: see on Odes 1. 14. 9.

55. maturos (p) i.e. in spite of their age they were taken. In ancient
warfare old men received scant attention when a retreat began.

56. Ausonias (ps) i.e. (carried them through) right to Italy. Compare on
Odes 1. 31. 9.

57. duris...bipennibus: for the grouping see on P. 15. The position of ut
may be due to metrical convenience; but the crzcelty to the oak (duris ilex)
only makes it grow the more (see on P. 27). Fpr the position of ut in corn-
parison see on Odes 1. 15. 29, and for words like durus preposited or separated
see Odes 2. 14. 23.

58. nigrae feraci frondis in Algido: for the grouping see on P. 9. The
order says ‘mid darkness in plenty, leafage on Algidus.'

59, 60. ab ipso: the far separation results in great emphasis for serra.
We wait for the noun, expecting anything butferro.

61. non=‘it is not the case that...'; see on Odes 2. 9. 13.

hydra secto corpore firmior: the grouping may be that of Ρ. 18. But
secto (p)...firmz'0r may mean ‘stronger with the cutting (of its body)'; see on
P. 26. In factfirmz'or does double duty i.e. ‘The Hydra, more strong· with...,
not more strongly grew...) See on odes 1. 23. 12.

62. vinci dolentem (ps): see on P. 21.

64. maius (pps) is predicative i.e. ‘that was g1·eate1·'; see too on odes
4. 9. 26.

Echioniae (p): perhaps the position is on the analogy of preposited
patronymic genitives; see Ι). 41, and on odes 1. 15. 22.

66, 67. multa...victorem: sor the grouping see on P. 9.
