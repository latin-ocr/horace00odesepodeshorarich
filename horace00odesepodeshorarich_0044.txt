8 HORACE

sive tu mavis, Erycina ridens,

quarn Iocus circum volat et Cupido;

sive neglectum genus et nepotes 35
respicis auctor,

heu nimis longo satiate ludo,
quern iuvat clamor galeaeque leves,
acer et Mauri peditis cruentum
vultus in hostem; 40

sive mutata iuvenem figura

ales in terris imitaris, almae

filius Maiae, patiens vocari
Caesaris ultor:

serus in caelum redeas diuque 45
laetus intersis populo Quirini,
neve te nostris vitiis iniquum

ocior aura

33. Erycina ridens: see on P. 36.

34. volat: note the position by com'uncti03 circum velat is practically
one word.

35. neglectum (p): Mars had abandoned his offspring, Romulus and
Remus, at the outset of Rome's history, and he abandons them again, although
responsible for their existence (auctor); hence auctor comes last in l. 36.

37. longo (s): the position gives additional point to ludo when we hear it.
Mars is watehing ‘games’ and these—mirabile dictu—are ‘too long.⁷ But see
P. 24.

39. acer et Mauri peditis...vultus: for the grouping see P. 10.

cruentum (ps) has stress. As Bentley sayS‚ the Mauri were not fortes;
but they can scowl at a bleeding (fallen) foeman. This position of cruentum
perhaps makes Marsi a less probable emendation. The word pedz'tzlv might
mean that the Maurian has dismounted.

41. mutata iuvenem figura: for the order see on Odes 1. 10. 14. Com-
pare too on Odes 3. 2. 32.

42. ales in terris: an angel, as it were, on earth.

almae (ps): nurturing like a kindly mother, not destroying like Mars. See
also P. 20 a.

44. Caesaris (p): perhaps equals ‘Great Caesar’; compare Odes 1. 37. 16.

45. serus is predicative.

redeas: for the re· compare ἀπό in ἀποθέωσις.

diu goes with both laetus and intersis.

47. te: foi· its position see P. 51.
nostris (p): the order brings out the antithesis, and case relations come
early; see Odes 1. 2. 17.
