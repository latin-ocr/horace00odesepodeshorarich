ια per dolum amun, put-nim: a Roman may read amotas as ira de-
ponent agreeing with pumat—&inqu κλέψαντα παῖδα. See note on l. 14 below
and especially the citation from Liw 1. 4. 6.

12. Apollo comes last in antithesis to te of l. ᾳ Compare Livy 1. 5. 7
where a long sentence begins with Romulus and ends with Remus.

13. Atridas duee te. sor the grouping see note on l. 9. The order gives
the sense ‘and now for the Atridae and your leading past them (cruel pair. ')
priam...) But the position os superbos is very awkward; see however P. soc.
n* ve had superbos duce le Atridas, the words could hardly mean anything
save ‘the Atridae proud os your leadership,' and it may be that even with the
adjective last there would be ambiguity for anyone ignorant of the facts.

14. nio dives Priamus relicto: the position of Priamus between llio and
relitto, as is relicto were a deponent governing llio (Ἴλιον ό n. καταλιπόν), is
common in Livy and Caesar. Compare Livy 1. 7. 11 dextra Hercules daim

15. Thettalos (p): i.e. os the enemy and that enemy the most bitter.

17, 18. pias laetis anisius reponis Ι sedibus: sor the grouping see on
P. 9. The order is picturesque: the pious to happiness, their souls to a fixed
duellinm they do not wander homeless and unlaid. Hence, perhaps, there
is some stress on sedimen see Odes 4. 9. 26.

aot gratiis sc. ὅν. The word lies, by coniunctio, between superis and
inus.

This Ode would seem to be an early experiment in translation, isone may
judge by the srequency os strained order and the absence os caesura in ll. 1,
6, 10, and 18;contrast such Odes as 1. 2, and 1. 22.
