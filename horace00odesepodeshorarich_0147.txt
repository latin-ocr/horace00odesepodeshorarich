ODES 11. 17-18 109

me petit: nihil supra
deos lacesso nec potentem amicum
largiora flagito,
satis beatus unicis Sabinis.
truditur dies die ⁸3
novaeque pergunt interire lunae:

Horace hastens to tell us his two outstanding qualities ς hence ingeniis placed

aas too with death before you.'

”pulcri is preposited partly to echo sunus, partly because sepulcri is an
objective genitive (see P. 39).

dunen forits position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

πο. marin (ps) is logical object os submovere i.e. the sea (and its shoresl;
see on Ρ. 38. Moreover Horace wishes to keep maris close to the antithetic
