ιο. en'guo fine libidinum: sor the grouping see on P. 35.

ιι. avidi coming last has emphasis and is causal i.e. ‘because they are
greedy and sun of passion!

candide (p): forits position see on Ρ. 36.

12. variis obnita frondibus: sor the grouping see on Ρ. 24.

13, 14. neva...cum Berecyntio Ι cornu tympana: for the grouping see
on P. io

Berecyntio is always preposited in Horace3 the sound of a born is not
dangerous, but tbe sound os Cybele’s is. Compare on odes 3. ¹9- 18 and
4. 1. 22.

quae mboequitur: the picture seems to be that os a pageant; first come
horn and drums, then comes blind Seli-love, then vain Pride, then Faith un-
saithiul. Compare Lucretius 5. 737-747.

enema (ὣς Love is blind, but especially blind is Seli-love; amor sui may
be regarded as one word φιλαυτία (see on Ρ. 45). But caecus amor sui may
be classified under P. 35.

15. tollens vacuum...gloria verticem: sor the grouping see on P. 9.

phu nimio has emphasis because it follows and is separated from its verb
tollens.

16. arcani has emphasis, sor it should lie between fides and prod-{ga (sec
on Ρ. 43); Faith should be prodigal os F aith only, not of secrets. It may,
however. be remembered that an objective genitive usually precedes the word
upon which it depends (see on P. 39).

perlucidior vitro is an emphatic addendum ς see on P. 53. The statue os
fides is said to have worn, perhaps on the right hand, a white veil, symbo-
lizing that Fides was (rank and open (white). yet kept her secrets (veil); but
ω be perlucidior vitro is going too sar altogether. Compare on Odes 1. 35. 21,
and for the white veil see Livy 1. 21. 4, and Servius on Vergil Aen. 1. 292
and 8. 636. Ovid speaks offides as liquida (Ex Ponto 1. 9. ιο).

xlx. 1. Mater saeva Cupidinum: a very rare order (see on Ρ. 44>; it is
just possible that saeva is felt to qualify both Alater and Cupidinum (see
P. 52), and coenpare Odes 3. 15. 15fios purpureus rosae. See too on Θεία
3. ι. 42. Contrasi Odes 4. 1. 4 dulcium Ι rnater saeva Cupidinum, and P. 36.
