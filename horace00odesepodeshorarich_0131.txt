ODES ιι. ιι 93

cur non sub alta vel platano vel hac
pinu iacentes sic temere et rosa
canos odorati capillos, ι,
dum licet, Assyriaque nardo

potamus uncti? dissipat Euhius
curas edacis. quis puer ocius
restinguet ardentis falerni
pocula praetereunte lympha? ιο

quis devium scortum eliciet domo
Lyden? eburna dic age curn lyra
maturet, incomptum Lacaenae
more comae religata nodum.

vultu by position, perhaps, has stress (see on Odes 4 9. 26) ; it may
emphasize the transitoriness of sacia} expression.

ιι, 12. atad-...animum for the grouping see on P. 9.

consilii· is comparative ablative with nu'norem, and instrumental ablative
with fatigas (see on odes 1. 28. 23).

ι3. non: for its position see on Odes 2. 9. ¹3·

‘alta (ps): height implies shade; thus the sense is ‘under the shadow (of
the plane)'; see on P. 27. The adJ'ective, as is shown by vel...vel, belongs to
both platano and pinu.

14. demae: the words go, by coniunctio, with potamus as well as tacentes.

15. cano· (ps) i.e. ‘in spite of our white hairs‘ See also on P. 24.

16. dum lieet belongs, by coniunctio, to the preceding lines and also to
patmus.

Astyria (p): in contr-ast, perhaps, to the inferior saliunca or Celtic nard
(see Vergil Ecl. ς. 17). Horace would ‘do it in style' with Syrian nard (hence
the separation from uncti) and Falernian wine.

19. aderitis (p): the word is purposely kept close to restinguet, as if we
had ardorem Falerni (see on P. 27). See also on Odes 1. 27. 9.

Falerni (p): contrast cheaper wines. See also on P. 38.

ιο. praetereunte lympha: a picturesque addendum (see on P. 53) re-
minding us that the dinner is out of doors. See too on odes 3. 1. 34.

21. devium (p): her shyness is the point; otherwise she would need no
enticing. But see emendations.

22. Lyden: the position seems to be without point (see on Ode-s 4. 9. 20),
and it is tempting therefore to read eburnam with Lyden i.e. ‘white as ivory';
compare Ovid Am. 3. 7. 7 bracchia eburnea, Her. 20. 50 cer-mlx eburnea. and
Propertius 2. ι. 9 eburni dtjgr'ei. The reading eburna (ps) presents other
difficulties ; a scortum, especially is shy, could hardly afiord a lyre os ivory.
whether this means ‘inlaid with ivory' or ⁴ having ivory horns to support the
crossi-piet& and the only justification for the position of eburna (ps) is that
our attention is drawn to rnore ⁸swagger‚’ like Syn‘an nard and Falerm'an wine.
