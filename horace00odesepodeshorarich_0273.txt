EPODES ι-2 235

nec ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia. ,ιο
satis superque me benignitas tua
ditavit: haud paravero.
quod aut avarus ut Chremes terra premam,
discinctus aut perdam ut nepos

11.

‘Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis,
ut prisca gens mortalium,

paterna rura bobus exercet suis,
solutus omni faenore,

neque excitatur classico miles truci, s
nec horret iratum mare,

ν’ nepem·...Tuscuei must go with villa first, though later with moenia also,
λ- For the quasi-locative genitive super-111⁹...Tusculi compare Livy ι. 31. 3
' vocem...e.r summi cacum'm‘s luco.

3ο. Circaea (ps): see on P. 21.

3¹. satin superque: sor the emphasis by separation compare on libenter
ι ²{xe precedes the abstract subject; see on P. 5¹-
, 32. ditavit has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26): Maecenas has not merely
ᾖ helped Horace 3 he has made him a rich man, rich. that is, in the eyes of
noxe-‘34- avarus sc. ὢν agreeing with ego understood; the same is true os
«ἀτάκτως both epithets are felt again with Chremes and naepos respectively.

ι Compare Ovid Her. 12. 26 quam paler est illi, lam mihi dives erat, sor quam

γ pater dives ese illi, tam mihi pater dives erat. See too on Epod- 5. 27, and
¹ ὁ. ,ξφ discincttss precedes aut to ensorce the antithesis mrarus.

11. 2. prisca gens mortalium: sor the grouping see on P. 35, but gens
mortalium is a mere compound for homines (compare rann} arborum in Ι. 56),

’ and prisca then has some strcss, ‘the good old' (see on Odes 3. 9. ¹7) in

contrast to haec nova gens.

3- pamm (ὣς he is no neweomer, no returned soldier put on the land ς
these fields belonged to his fathers.

suis (s): see on Epod. ι. 26, and odes ι. 1. 9, ι. 1. ιι. Compare too on
P· ²4¹.. uolutus...iaenore is a causal addendum elrplaining suis os 1. 3. See on
Ρ. ςςῗ. truci: perhaps the separated adjective is read as is ad truculentiam
with excitatum in any case it colours miles :ts well as classa-0 (see on P. 52).

6. iratum (p) i.e. ‘the anger (of the sea)'; see on Ρ. 27.
