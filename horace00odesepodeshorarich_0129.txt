ingen· has some stress because it comes last in the line.

10. pium may have emphasis (see on odes 4. 9. 26) to mark the idea of
tallness; but there is no real pause aster it.

celtae (ps) echoes the possible emphasis on ingens l. 9.

gnviore (p): see on P. 28.

11. &numos (ps) also echoes ingens and celsae. For the iteration of an
idea, compare on non semper at Odes 2. 9. 1.

14. alteram i.e. ‘a change (of fortune)’; see on P. 27.

bene praeparatum (p) has emphasis i.e. ‘ if well-balanced.⁸

15. pectus should, perhaps, have stress <see on Odes 4. 9. 26); there is
nothing either good or bad but the pectus makes it so. Compare Epis-t. 1. 1 1. 30.

inim! (p) i.e. ‘the repulsiveness (os winter)’; see on P. 27, and Odes
2. 14. 23. In Horace informis appears to have the one sense of ‘ugly.¹ Others
here translate by ¹ shapeless.’

17. ammovet has stress (see on Odes ⁴- 9. 26); contrast reducit. The
celestia! policeman ⁸ moves them on.’

non (s): see on Odes 2. 9. ¹3·

18, 19. quondam (s): contrast neque semper (s).

citharae3 cithara is the reading os the best MSS; it goes first with tacentem
(silent in point of the lyre), then with suscitat (awakes by the lyre). Π citharae
be read, we may still take it as a genitive in point of which with tacentem: it
cau hardly go with Musam: the separation seems to have no point.

&centem (ps) is causal; see also P. 21.

22. idem is merely a strong autem i.e. ‘but on the other hand’; hence
sapimter is very slightly separated from the verb.

23, 24. vento-..necundo Ι turgida vela: note the chiasmus. The words
vento...secundo are in the ablative of attendant circumstances. Horace is not
writing abuomany the normal turgida vento secundo vela; what hc says is
‘since the wind is too strong behind. you will be wise to furl m›ell1·eae,4r(turfflkia
preposited) sans! Compare on Odes 3. 13. 4, 5.
