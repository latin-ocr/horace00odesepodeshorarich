ODES t.14-15 3¹

Nereus sata: ‘mala ducis avi domum. ⁸

quam multo repetet Graecia milite,
coniurata tuas rumpere nuptias
et regnum Priami vetus.

heu heu. quantus equis, quantus adest viris
sudor! quanta moves funera Dardanae ιο
genti! iam galeam Pallas et aegida

currusque et rabiem parat.

nequicquam Veneris praesidio ferox

pectes caesariem grataque feminis

inbelli cithara carmina dividem 15
nequicquam thalamo gravis

being subject of the principal clause; but in such cases the new subject is
inserted with the principa} verb. Here there is no hint of a new subJ'ect until
ve reach the subordinate clause ut caneret. Nauck quotes odes 1.16. 5 where
there is scarcely any difficulty, and Vergil Aen. 12. 641 occiaeht infel& ne nos-

muu dedecus Ufens Ι aspicerem but this latter example' is comparatively simple
because no other subject to occ-adst is possible (see too P. ιο). May not obrute
be a kind os middle? i. e. ‘Because Paris was carrying off another man ’s wife,

he brought on himself a calm so that Nereus was enabled to tell his fate)

2. ldaa‘s Helenen: the antithesis os Trojan (ship) and Greek woman is
well brought out.

perfidus hospitam: see on Odes 1. 6. 9 and P. 53.

3, 4 ingrato...ventos: sor the grouping see on Ρ. 7. The antithesis os
ingrato aud alerir has point: the swift winds do not love inaction.

fera ( ps) i.e. mala, non bona.

5. mala (ps) has emphasis; compare Livy PresI 5 13ϊιιιη bonis· potius
omwbus. But see also P. 21.

6. multo (s) is emphatic i.e. ‘with myriads of soldiers.' ln English prose
we prefer definite figures: Latin is satisfied with obscuret and, to our ears.
weaker expressions. Thus Livy 1. 12. ιο favore multorum addito animo may
be translated ‘the cheers of thousands gave him fresh courage.’ Compare too
Plato's famous epigram ὣς πολλοῖς ὄμμασιν οἷς σε βλέπω.

7. tuas (ps): perhaps in antithesis to Priami ς but see P. 21.

9, ιο. quantun...⁸udort quanta...funera: sor the separation of quantus
and quanta from their respective nouns see on Odes 1. 27. 11.

nidor perhaps has stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

Dardanae (p) i.e. you are destroyingyourown people; seeon tuae 1.21 below.

11. gusti has stress (see on odes 4 9. 26) i.e. you are destroying a whole
naum See l. 22 below.

Pallas lies by com'unctio between galeam and aeg-isia. For galeam Pallas
see on Ode-r ι. 2. 17.

13. Venerin (pk Venus should protect a lover and an adulterer ; the order
too makesserox an the more effective: it is Mars who renders a manserunt.
