EPODES 9-10 255

capaciores affer huc. puer. scyphos
et chin vina aut Lesbia,

Χ.

Mala soluta navis exit alite,
serens olentem Mevium:

ut horridis utrumque verberes latus,
Auster, memento fluctibus;

niger rudentis Eurus inverso mari 5
fractosque remos differat;

30· non mis (s) equals adverse‘s; see on P. 29. and also on P. 2⁴·

3¹- meinu- (ps) i.e. ‘the turmoil (os the Syrtis)’; see on P. 26.

Noto must be felt in part with petit i.e. by means os Notus, by tacking in
sace of Notus. 15 Noto went only with exercitatas, why did not Horace write
the obvious aut Noto S yrle's peta? See too on odes 1. 14. ιο.

Odes 312. 2, 3.13. 2, etc.

on P. 8. The juxtaposition of horr-tuis utrumque (bon-ors on both sides) is

happy·
fl ς. 6. niger (ps) seems to equal an adverbia! phrase e.g. ‘in the blackness¹:
see on P. 31. The adjective may colour mdenezzr as well as Eurum see on

ξ P. 52.

niger rudentis: the elements os the picture are set early (see on Odes
