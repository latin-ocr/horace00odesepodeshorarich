126 HORACE

non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae:
quo, Musa, tendis? desine pervicax 70
referre sermones deorum et
magna modis tenuare parvis.

IV.

Descende caelo et dic age tibia
regina longum Calliope melos,
seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
seu fidibus citharave Phoebi.

auditis, an me ludit amabilis 5
insania? audire et videor pios
errare per lucos, amoenae
quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.

69. iocosae (ps) is rightly brought close to lzoc which implies tm‘sle.
These themes will not suit the playfulness (see on Ρ. 27) of the lyre. See also
on P. 21.

70. pervicax equals an adverb ‘presumptuously’ (compare on P. 31), but
it may, of course, be vocative.

71. deorum et: see on Odes 1. 35. 39.

72. parvis, postposited and separated, is put last in contrast to magna.
See also P. 21.

IV. 2. longum (s): contrast the shortness of the average lyric.

Calliope: for the intervening vocative see on Odes 1. 5. 3.

3, 4. acuta (s) : whether we read seu, si, or et, and whatever be the general
interpretation, acuta, by position, expresses a contrast to the quieter music of
the cz'llzara.

For the general interpretation see the commentators. 1f I may comment
myself, I would say that acuta seems to be a most ungallant adjective when
applied to a lady's voice (compare the ‘ear-piercing cymbals’ of Odes 1. 16. 7).
At Odes 1. 12. 2 we find the alternative lyra vel acri tibia. The same alter-
native, Ι believe, is intended here; for vox is used of the souncl of strings at
A. P. 216, Sat. 1. 3. 8, Aerstmc), and even of oars at Aen. 3. 669, and there—
fore why may it not be used30f the tibia? Supposing we read si for scu before
voce (though it is not necessary), all is simple enough viz. ⁶ sing a melody to
the flute if you now prefer (to sing) to its slzrill note, or (sing) if (you so pre-
fer) to the lyre.' If we read seu voce the interpretation is the same, for the
first πατεῖ μέν, and the second εἰ δέ. Contrast the seu os l. 22 below.

5, 6. me: for its position see on P. 51.

amabilis (p): the order heightens the oxymoron ; see on Epod. 5. 82. But
amabilis may equal amabiliter (see on P. 31).

6. insania has stress as a paraprosdokian (see on Odcs 4. 9. 26).
