ODES 1. 1-2 5

terruit gentis, grave ne rediret 3
saeculum Pyrrhae nova monstra questae.
omne cum Proteus pecus egit altos

visere montis,

piscium et summa genus haesit ulmo.
nota quae sedes suerat columbis, to
et superiecto pavidae natarunt

aequore dammae.

ι, Odes 1. 3. 37,1.3ς. 35, Epod. 7· 3, 4,15. 12, 2ηά see note on Epod. 1. 21.

b This separation is almost the rule in Livy eg. 1. 12. 1, 3. 49. 8, 3. 58. 8,

, 4. 5313, 21. 8. 5, etc. and 34. 2.1, 6. 3,12. 3,14.5, 29. 6, etc.

, 1, 2. dine (ωε the terror (of hail); see P. 27 and note on Odes 2. ¹4 23

3 But the adjective may be cin-<l κοινοῦ, with both nivis and grande‘m's; sec
2. pater goes, by coniunctio, with misit and terrram hence its position.

. rubente (p): i.e. red flash (os hand); see P. 26.

Γ, 3. καις (ps) equals ‘though sacred to himself! Compare odes 1. 12. 60

s fidtm'na [καὶ. But see also P. 21.

’ 4. urbem placed aster the verb, with stress, in contrast to gentas, itsell'

· aster its verb. The antithesis is Rome and the empire.

5. grave (ps): the position of grave makes it quasi-internal with rediret,
i.e. ‘lest a noxious return should be of Pyrrha‘s age.’ The adjective gravis is
frequently used of recurring (note rediret) seasons of unhealthy or noxious
kind. The regular phrase sor the unwholesome part of the year is grave
tempus, with grave prepositive; compare Livy 3. 6. 2 grave tempus, 3. 8. 1
graviore tempore anni iam circumacto and passim. See also note on odes
2. 14. 23.

6. 11οη ἰ.0. unheard of, horrible ; see on Epod 16. 30. This adjective is
almost always prepositive as in novus homo. Compare Odes 1. ¹4· 1, etc.. but
contrast Odes 1. 7. 29,1.26. 10, 3. 4. 12, 3 25. 3, 4. 4. 16, 4. 12. ¹9·

7. mnne (s): Proteus could not leave even part of his flock below.

altos (ps): not merely ‘high mountains,’ but, predicative‚ ‘to the top οἱ
the mountains'—‹'c ἄκρα γὸ ὅρη-01· ‘to the heights (os the mountains)'; see
P. 27 and also P. 21.

9. piscium (ps): the order prepares us sor the antithesis columbam but
praciam also equals piscan'um, and the grouping is then that os ll. 11, 12
belowz see P. 7 and 12. Moreover piscium is logical ’ subject; see on

uhno: seeon odes1.1.14 adfin.

10. mn (ps): the tree was so high that it had been a well-known land-
mark‚ white with doves.

colmnhin: last, in antithesis to piscium l. 9 above.

11, 12. 211ροήοοφ pavidae natarunt ξ aequore dammae: sor this important

grouping see P. 7.
