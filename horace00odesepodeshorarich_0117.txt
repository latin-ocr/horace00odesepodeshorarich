ont-:s 11. 4-5 81

ρηοςαιίεηῑίε. tolle cupidinem
immitis uvae: iam tibi lividos no
distinguet autumnus racemos
purpureo varios colore.

iam,te sequetur: currit enim ferox
aetas et illi, quos tibi dempserit.
apponet annos: iam proterva ις,
fronte petet Lalage maritum,

dilecta, quantum non Pholoe fugax,
non Chloris albo sic umero nitens
ut pura nocturno renidet
luna mari, Cnidiusve Gyges: ιο

9. praetendentia is a strong word in an emphatic position (see on odes
4. 9. 26 and compare on Odes 3. ¹7- 3).

10-12. inmitia (p): because ‘unripe' is the point.

livido· (ps) is in contrast to immitis.

12. vario· is Bentley’s reading and gives, perhaps, the best sense. 1 sus-
pect that three stages of colour are denoted in 11. 10—12 : (¹) the hard opaque
green (iuventamn (2) the semi—transparent grey-green (lhn'dos) which gives
a patchy effect (aelisn‘nguet): (3) the deep purple which begins in the half of
the grape furthest from the stem and thus makes the racemus look varius
or var-talus (i.e. ‘striped’). In fact varios expresses the result of Autumn's
action. The sense, therefore, seems to be ‘soon you will find that Autumn
speekles the early-ripening grey-green (lividos) of the grapes so that they
become strealted (varios) with purple colour.' See Postgate on Propertius
⁵- ²· ¹³·

purpureo varios colore: sor the grouping see on P. 24. 1 f we read varius,
thoee three words form a picturesque addendum describing Autumn as he
would be dressed in some pageant.

13. ferox (p) equals an adverb with eurr-in see on P. 3¹-

14. netu: for its position see on Odes 3. ¹7. 15.

15. annot: forits position see on Odes ι, 3. 16.

mvn (p) bas stress: Lalage will ‘rush you.'

18. albo (ps) i.e. ‘with the whiteness (of her shoulder)’; see on P. 27,
and note on Odes 2. 4. 3. The word albo is also brought close to Chloris
sor artificial antithesis of colouring. For the resultant position of sic sec
on P. 50 d, and sor the whole grouping Chloris albo...umcro nitens see
P. 18.

19, 20. pma...mafi· for the grouping see on P. 7. Α Roman would read
thus: ‘clear in the night shines the moon upon the sea)

cnidius (ps): the position, perhaps. is meant to remind us of the effemi-
nacy associated viu: the worship of Venus at Cnidos.
