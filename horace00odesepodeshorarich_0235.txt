ODES ιν, ⁴ ¹97

videre Raeti bella sub Alpibus
Drusum genemem Vindelici (quibus
mos unde deductus per omne
tempus Amazonia securi ιο

dextras obarmet, quaerere distuli.
nec scire sas est omnia). sed diu
lateque victrices catervae
consiliis iuvenis revictae

sensere, quid mens rite, quid indoles ι,
nutrita faustis sub penetralibus
posset, quid Augusti paternus
in pueros animus Nerones,

laetis capnapasnazs may be roed first as ‘the hind in lush pasture'3 for the
order see on Odes ⁴- 8· 33. and 3. 2. 32.

intenta probably bas stress (see on odes 4. 9. 26); the hind is busy eating
and suddenly looks up to see-death 2

14, 15. (ulvae (p): the order has no point. lndeed it is hopeless to dis-
cover the true construction of these lines. See the manisold variety os the

commentators.

antlia ab ubete: the order is paralleled by odes 4. 6. 2ος see too note on
3. 27. 12.

iam 1⁸1:oe depalatum this preposited group emphasizes the bungry condi-
tion οἱ the young lion ς he wants his mother and what she can give him (hence,
perhaps, matris is preposited); but new instincts suggest that the caprea may
form a satisfactory substitute.

16. novo: (1) ‘never used before,‘ from the lion’s point of view (see on
odes ι. 3¹- 2); (2) ‘dread’ ‘aiduh’ from the hind’s point of view (see tbe note
on novus at odaes 1. 2. 6). Here, perhaps, the adjective has stress by being
postposited.

17, 18. Raeti: the separation of Raeti from Vindelici is meaningless and
almost without parallel in the Odes and Epodes (see on odes 4. 1. ιο, ιι).
ls it possible that the Romans sancisuny associated the root of m'ndex with
Vindelici? Π this were the case, the adjective thus separated would have
ironica! point. Others read Raetis (ps) i.e. ‘in Raetia’; see on Odes ι. 3¹· 9.
The subject too may be found in Raetis· i.e. ‘the Raeti ’ (see on odes
¹· ¹5· 33)-

18-22. quibusmomnia: this ridiculous parenthesis calls for little comment.
ll' Horace wrote it, he shows to what depths a poet laureate can descend.

20. Amazonia (ὣς our attention is drawn, by the order, to this epithct.
but why ve cannot tell. The scholiasts are, l suspect, just guessing.

22-24. diu Ι lateque victrices: this group‚ being emphatic, is rightly pre-
posited. The group consiliis iuvenis revictae forms a second epithet. and we
bave the type of Ode-r t. ι. 2 dulce decus meum (see on P. 34).
