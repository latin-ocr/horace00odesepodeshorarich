turn meae, siquid loquar audiendum. ⁴³

Caesare felix.

‘t'o'que dum procedis, ‘io triumphe!'
non semel dicemus ‘io triumphel' 30
civitas omnis¹ dabimusque divis

tura benignis.

te decem tauri totidemque vaccae,

me tener solvet vitulus, relicta

matre, qui largis iuvenescit herbis 35
in mea vota,

45. meae (ps) i.e. ‘then comes my turn.' Α Roman feels meae as if it were
ego (see on Odes 1. 15. 33), contrasted with tu of concines in 1. 41 above.

audiendum (s) has modest suess, ὅξιόνγι τοῦ daonium See too P. 21.

46t voda (ps) is placed early as if subject (see on P. 38 and P. 43). Α
Roman reads thus: ‘my voice shall be added—a good part os it.¹ When
bonus equals magnus, like all adjectives os quantity, it is preposited.

47. pulcher should have stress (see on Odes 4. ᾳ 26). Compare too on

recepto (p) i.e. ‘at the coming back (of Caesar)’; see on P. 26.

49, 50· Order throws no light on the vexed question os the reading.

51. munia (pp) has emphasis and equals universa, cuncta.

52. benignis (s) is causal i.e. ‘ior their goodness.’

53, 54. te...t⁸uri... , me...aolvet vitulus: the order expresses the antithesis
ol' σι’ μ’νηλμὶ δὲ...

tenet (ps): the idea os tenderness placed early suggests at once something

small, in contr-ast to the solid massiveness of ten bulls and ten cows. See too
P. 21.

54, 55. relicta Ι matre: there is some stress on matre (see on Odcs
4. 9. 26), and one cannot help feeling that the words mean more than ⁴ just
weaned’ os the vitulus. 1n any case the phrase is quasi-parenthetic and thus
the (otherwise) ugly collocation mettre qui is less noticeable. Horace seems
to say ⁸you, Antonius, send ten bulls and ten cows; 1 send one male calf and
no cow (lit. leaving behind the ’,φακὴ-11 calf which...) The poet cannot
afford to give up the cow: if he does, where is he to get other victims, not to
mention his milk? ln his Epist. ι. 3. 36 Horace is plainly promising a rich
sacrifice when he writes pascitur in vestrum reditum votiva iuvenca. See too
Odes 1. 36. 2 et tritula· sanguine.

This interpretation of relicta matre avoids the objection that a cali recently
weaned has no horns which could be described as crescent-shaped. Vergil
at Georg. 4. 299, is nearer the truth in saying Tum vitulus bima cantans iam

ran. ¹3
