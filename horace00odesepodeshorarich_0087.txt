mercede. quae te cumque domat Venus,

ignibus ingenuoque semper

Sat. 2. 4. 24. lt is usually assumed that severunt Falernum- Pliny's austerum,
and the adjective is taken to mean ‘rough. tart, and dry.’ But the stress on
mm* remains unexplained. May not severi be contrasted with ardenttlr and
sortis. seeing that severus is always associated with sobriety os behaviour?
Horace then says ‘Do you wish rne to drink with you. but none of your fiery
stufft’ Compare the innocentis Lesbii os Odes 1. ¹7· 21.

lt is not impossible to take seven· as nominative plural i.e. ‘Do you wish
to bebave yourselves (κυσί- σοφρονοῡνης) and make me also take a share
of Falernian?' Horace knew the value osa sudden change os topic when the
party is growing quarrehome, especially if the interruption concerns the love
affairs of a guest.

For severus in the sense of‘sobered’(?) compare Epod. 11. ¹9-

ιι, 12. quo beatus 1 vulnere, qua pereat sagitta: such separation os
relative or interrogative from its noun is common at all periods and in all
authors ς compare Cicero Div. in Caec. 2. 4 quo ego adiumento sperabam, and
Horace Odes 1. ις. 9, ιο, ι. 26. 4, 1. 35. 38, 2. ι. 36, 2. 7. 25,3. 3. 53, 3. 2ο. ι,

2. 37, 6. 8, 12. 7, ¹7· 36, and ll. ¹9 and 22 below.

non alia ( ps) i.e. ‘on these and no other tenns'; see on P. 29, and corn-
pare Odes 1. 36. 8. See too P. 21.

14. mercede should have suess: see on odes 4. 9. 26. Perhaps the implied
antithesis is vi i.e. you may force me, but no other bribe will persuade me.
