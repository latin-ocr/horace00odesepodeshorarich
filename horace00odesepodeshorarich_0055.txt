ODES 1. 7-8 ¹9

nil desperandum Teucro duce et auspice Teucro:

certus enim promisit Apollo
ambiguam tellure nova Salamina suturam.

ο sorte· peioraque passi 30
mecum saepe viri. nunc vino pellite curas:

cras ingens iterabimus aequor.'

VIII.

Lydia, dic, per omnis
te deos oro, Sybarin cur properes amando

perdere, cur apricum
oderit campum, patiens pulveris atque solis,

cur neque militaris 5
inter aequalis equitet, Gallica nec lupatis

27. Tenem duee...‘reuero: these words form an emphatic addendum ;
see P. 53. Note the chiastic order Teucro duce...ausp1·ce Teucro.

28. certus (ps) equals an adverb ‘without oracular evasion’; see on
P. 31.

29. ambiguam tellure nova Salamina: the order is normal (adjective,
complement—eellure πονιτ-η noun) cp. Odes 1. 1. 26, 1. 8. 14, etc., 2. 7. 7,
8, 2. 8. ⁶, etc.. ΕΜ 9. 5, 17. 33. But the grouping may be regarded as that
os P. ¹5-

nova (pp) probably has stress; see on Odes 1. 2. 6.

31. mecm nepe viri: emphatic addenda i.e. ‘with me—often—Iike
heroes’ See on P. 53.

curas: for its position see Odes 1. 3. 16.

32. cras (s): i.e. without a day’s delay.

Ingenuo: i.e. sor all its monstrous and mysterious size. Professor Conway
has shown the air os mystery which so often attaches to ingens in Vergil (cp.
Odes 4. 9. 19). See also P. 21.

vm. 1, 2. per omnis Ι te deos oro: the position os te in such petitions
is common in both Latin and Greek. Compare Terence Andr. 8 34 per ego
u deas oro, and see Livy 23. 9. 2 per ego te...precor. So Ovid Heroid. ιο. 73,
and Horace Epod. 5. 5, 17. 3. Here however the presence os omnis (separated
aud therefore emphatic) conceals the hyperbaton.

Sybarin is brought sorward out of its clause so as to make clear, and that
early, the persons concemed in the Ode. The subject is the loves of Lydia
and sybaris (see on odes 1.2. 17). Perhaps too the order is on the analogy
of Greek σῶά σι τίς οἷ. Compare too note on odes 1. 4. ιο.

3- ιρτίαιιιι (ps): the heat (os the Campus); see on P. 27, and also P. 21.

⁴· patim. ..nolin a concessive addendum (see on P. 53) i..e though
accustomed to endure.

5. militaris: concessive i.e. ‘though a soldier!
