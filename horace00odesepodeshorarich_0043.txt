21-24. audiet.,.audiet munumentum the inverted sentence and the
repetition os auam make the verb emphatic—they will hear of these things,
hut not imitate them.

21. civia-..ferrumt the separation of civis from serrum brings out the
point; citizens (i.e. know-citizens) should not arm contra civis, but contra
Persas.

22. ‘raven (ᾖε the interest lies in the adjective—the pest consisting os
Persae; see P. 27,andon Odes 2.14. 23.

lf melius had been placed next to quo, the meaning would have been ‘in
order that the Persae might more easily perish.' ln its present position the
construction is quo (with which) mlius esset (it would have been better) si
Persae perirent (is the Persae had been perishing).

23⁶ vitio potatum: the phrase, perhaps, goes with both pugnas and rara.
The eivil vars were due to the crimes os their fathers, and so was the reduced
popula-tion. Is Horace had not wished the words vitio parentum to be heard
with both pugnas and rara, he would not¹ have abandoned the normal order
ram vitio parentum iuventus. See P. 49.

3ο. luppiter has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. Great juppiter.
