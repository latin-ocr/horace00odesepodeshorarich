212 HORACE

nec, siquid olim lusit Anacreon,
delevit aetas; spirat adhuc amor v ιο
vivuntque commissi calores
Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

non sola comptos arsit adulteri
crines et aurum vestibus illitum
mirata regalisque cultus 15
et comites Helene Lacaena,

primusve Teucer tela Cydonio
derexit arcu; non semel Ilios
vexata; non pugnavit ingens
Idomeneus Sthenelusve solus 20

5, 6. non=‘it is·not the case that...’; see on Odes 2. 9. 13.

priores...Hornerus: for the grouping see on P. 7.

6-8. Pindaricae (ps): contrast Homerus. The same contrast accounts
for Ceae (ps), and for the position of the genitives Alcaei and Stesichori (see
on P. 43). The normal order would, of course, be minaces Alcaei (Camenae)
and graves Stesichori Camenae. The abnormal order stresses the antithetical
genitives, and also the antithetical adjectives.

9. Anacreon comes last in contrast to the poets named above.

10. adhuc (pp) has stress.

11, 12. vivunt is placed early to echo spirat adhuc.

commissi (p): i.e. because entrusted‚ in trust to.

commissi calores...fidibus: for the position of fidibus see on P. 47.

Aeoliae fidibus puellae: for the grouping see on P. 20 a.

13, 14. non sola: note the emphasis ; so primus (1. 17), non semel (1. 18),
solus (1. 20), primus (1. 24).

cornptos...crines: for the grouping, with intrusive arsit, see on P. 4611.
The order surely demands that crines be governed first by arsit and then by
mirata.

15. regalis (p) i.e. ‘the royalty (of his bearing and retinue)' ; see on P. 27.

17. cydonio (ps) i.e. ‘Cretan' The word implies‚ perhaps, the best
possible bow, as we might speak of a Toledo dagger (see on odes 1. 16. 9).
Compare too P. 21.

18. non semel: doubtless Ilios may stand sor any city, but it must be
remembered that Troy, according to the myth, was twice destroyed (see Am.
2. 642).

19. vexata should have stress; see on l. 26 below.

ingens: the position of this word with its air of mystery (see on odes
1. 7. 32) makes vivid the picture of combats between the giant warriors of old.

21, 22. ferox (fi)...acer (p): the fure os Hector and the boldness of
Deiphobus are contrasted artificially.

gravis (ps) has stress. See too l'. 21.
