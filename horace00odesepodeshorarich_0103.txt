the anvil 01 imperial acquisition. But 11 we give dsffingen iu proper senne.

Most commentators hold that Fortuna belongs permanently to the great
house. the ⁸ County family,' sometimes propitious, sometimes the reverse, and
that Spes 11ηά Fides stay with her (nec comitem abnegat), while only the
common people and the meretrix are faithless. But to this interpretation
there are serious objections. How can Fortuna remain with the great house
in view 01 linquis 1. 24 (Bentley cheerfully altered to verm). and, 11 Fortuna
does not desert, in what sense can she be called inimica when δραι and
Fides still accompany her? But elsewhere, when Fortune is adverse, she is
a daerter, as in Ovid Ex Ponto 3. 2. 9 ignoscimus illis Ι qui cum fortuna
terga dedere fugae, and Tris-t. 1. 5. 33 vix duo tresve mihi de 1ο1 τιμητής
mii,- cetera fortunae, non mea, turbafin't. 111 fact Fortune and Loyalty go
away together as Ovid tells us at Ex Ponto 2. 3. 10 et cum Fortuna statque
caditque Fides, and still more clearly and appositely ib. 1. 9. 15 adsuit ille
m'hi, mm ure flurs mag-na reliquit, stlatime, fortunae nec sui! ipse comes, i.e.
‘Celsus did not go with Fortuna when she deserted me! This last passage
surely throws light on nec comitem abnegat (1. 22 01 0111 Ode), which can
hardly «prun anything save that Spes and Fides, unlike Celsus, desert with
the d er Fortuna. Their behaviour indeed is illustrated by Ovid Ex Ponto
2. 3. diligitur nemo nari cuisortuna secunda est, and ib. 4. 3. 7 nunc, quia
convo-rr? vultum Fortuna, recedis. Note especially Hor. A. P. 200, 201.

111 view 01 these facts 1 would consider the sense of 11. 21-28 to be as

³ - follows: ‘Hope and Loyalty are the submissive servants (colit) os Fortuna:

they follow 111 1101 train (nec comitem abnegat) when the powerful go into
momuing and Fortuna deserts them in enmity. But (ae) what is true 01 the
great is no less true 01 1110 common folk (vulgus) 01 both sexes (meretrix)
there is no Fides to be 1011ηά amongst them in the hour 01 missortune, least
01 1111 amongst boon companions (amia). ’
