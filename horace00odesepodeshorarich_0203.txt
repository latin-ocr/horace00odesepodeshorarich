xxm.

Caelo supinas si tuleris manus
nascente luna. rustica Phidyle,
si ture placaris et horna
fruge Lara avidaque porca,

nec pestilentem sentiet Africum 5
secunda vitis nec sterilem seges
robiginem aut dulces alumni
pomifero grave tempus anno,

nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
devota quercus inter et ilices ιο
aut crescit Albanis in herbis
victima, pontificum securis

heaven might be a sign of mere irritation or despair, as Sat. 2. 5. 97 shows.
Hence the word sepinas is important.

manus: seeon odes 1. 3. 16.

2. nocente i.e. ‘at the birth (of the moon)’; see on P. 26.

mmte lum: these words stand in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position with both tuleris
and μαινίς.

rustica (p): see ou Ρ. 36. The word enforces the moral that being simple
herselsshe should be simple in her offerings. For the sense os mrim (homely)
see Ovid Heroid- 14. 132, 16. 285 (287), 17. 12, 13, 17. 186 etc.

3. placaris: note the ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position between ture and hornast-ugr.

hom(p): see on Odes 1. 19.15(br‘nu').

4. Lara: note the ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position between horna fimgt and avida
porca.

avida (p) implioe, presumably, that the porca was no skinny offering.

5. pestilentem i.e. ‘the bane <os Africus)'; see on P. 27 :md on P. 21.

6. fecunda (p): the stress is due to the sense os 1. 5. There has been no
hot wind; therefore the vine bears well.

sterilem (ps) i.e. ‘the blight (os rust)'; see on Ρ. 27.

7. dulcet (p) i.e. ‘your pets (the younglings)’; see ou P. 27.

8. ροωίἱεῐο...υωοε sor the grouping see on P. ιο.

9- nivssi (ps) i.e. ‘the snows (of Algidus)’; see 0¹². P. 27 and on Ρ. 21, and
compare Odes 1. 21. 6.

11. mani· (ps) is in artificia! contrast to Algido l. 9.

12, 13. victimet ifwe write a comma aster this word it has some emphasis
(see on odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘it is sattened (crescit comes early) only to be a
victim‚' as if we had κονίαν-α (see note on odes 1. 28. 6).

pontificum (ῥὶε contrast rusum Phidyle and te. which comes early to
enforce the antithesis. At the same time pontificum may be felt as ἀπὸ κοινοῦ
with both vt‘ctim and secum.
