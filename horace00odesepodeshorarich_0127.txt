ODES 11. 9 89

at non ter aevo functus amabilem
ploravit omnis Antilochum senex ⁸
annos, nec impubem parentes ι,
Troilon aut Phrygiae sorores

flevere semper. desine mollium
tandem querellarum, et potius nova
cantemus Augusti tropaea
Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten ιο

flebilibus (p) ite. ‘with tears (in your music)'; see on P. 27.

ιο. Vespero is, apparently, used sor ‘the stars rising after sunset' with
surgente. and, when sug-iente is reached, signifies ‘the stars disappearing in
the sunriseJ A Roman poet has no difficulty in saying that ⁴ Evening rises '
when he means that night begins. So Vergil Am 2. 8, in hinting that it is
high time sor bed. says that ‘the falling (setting) stars urge us to sleep’
(suadentque cadentia sidera somnos) i.e. ‘dawn is not sar off!

12. τιρίάιιιιι(ῥ.1) i.e. (1) ‘before the speed (osthe sun)’; (2) ‘before the
burning beat (oi the sun)’; the poet seels both ideas at once. For the position
of mpi‘dusn see on P. 27 and P. 21.

13, 14. non (s) means ‘it is not the case' that..) and qualifies the whole
sentence. Compare Odes 1. 17. 1, 2 sae-pe, 1. 27. 23 vix. 2. ια 9 saepius,

tamo-amma umbilern...omnis Antilochum senet annos: for the
elaborate grouping see on P. 6.

amabilem (ps) is concessive i.e. ‘though so beloved.'

14. omnis(s):seeonl. 1.

15. anno· is in a somewhat emphatic position (see on odes 4. 9. 26).
One wonder-s why Horace did not put annos in l. 14 ; sor omnis is the more
suitable word to carry the emphasis here. He may have been offended by
the assonance annos Antilochum; or he may have wished to preserve the
artificia! groupingsunctus amabilem omm'sAntilochum senex annon or again,
having written menses per omnis in L 6, he may have desired the variety os
onnisanms. But compare Odes 1. 8. ιο, 11, and Sat. 1.2. 114.

maban (ps) is concessive i.e. ‘though young.¹

16. Phryu‘ae (ps) i.e. if ‘barbariam’ could control their sorrow. surely
a civiliaed Roman ought to do so.

17. §anper postposited and last is emphatic; see on Ι. 1.

monitam (ps) has stress.

18. undem (pps) is emphatic (see l. 1). The pause at the end of l. 17
prevenis the necessity of grouping tandem with mollium and querellarum
(see on P. ςοὸ). It is possible to take tandem as if in a bracket with the
· sense ‘l pray’3 compare ΕΜ 17. 6 parce vocibus tandem sacnti.
