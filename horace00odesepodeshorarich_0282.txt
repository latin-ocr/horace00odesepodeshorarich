244 HORACE

et ossa ab ore rapta ieiunae canis
flammis aduri Colchicis.
at expedita Sagana per totam domum 25
spargens Avernalis aquas
horret capillis ut marinus asperis
echinus aut currens aper.
abacta nulla Veia conscientia
ligonibus duris humum 30
exhauriebat ingemens laboribus,
quo posset infossus puer
longo die bis terque mutatae dapis
inemori spectaculo,
cum promineret ore, quantum extant aqua 35
suspensa mento corpora:

23. ieiunae canis: for the position of these words see on P. 48.

ieiunae (p): the starving condition of the bitch emphasizes the disgusting
nature of the ossa.

24. Colchicis (s): heard last, this word sums up the awful picture i.e. ‘in
flames of witchcraft.' Compare Marsis (ps) at 1. 76 below. See too Ρ. 21.

25. expedita (p) equals an adverb eg. celeriter; see on P. 31.

26. Avernalis (p): more sorcery. Compare the effect of sepulcris 1. 17,
nocturnae l. 20, and Colchicis l. 24.

27. capillis is read with horret3 then, after echinus, the words capillis
horret are heard again and the grouping is that of P. 14. Compare on Epod.
1· 33, 34·

28. currens (p): Bentley, aster Heinsius, reads Laurens on the ground
that a boar’s bristles do not rise when he is running. But Horace, like Ovid
Hal. 60, may have believed that a boar, when flying from the dogs, behaves
like a porcupine. In any case the epithet is not pointless, for currens echoes
expedita of 1. 2 5 ; the boar runs, and so does Sagana.

29. abacta...conscientia: for the grouping see on P. 9.

32. quo posset infossus (p)...inemori: the effect of infossus preposited is
as if we had quo posset infodi puer et..,inemori. Compare cum semel-fixae of
1. 39 below, and see Epod. 10. 5, 10. 6, 10. 13, 11. 13, 17. 5. Add Odcs 3. 3.
7, and 3. 6. 40.

33, 34. bis terque: the words lie in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position with dle and
mutatae.

mutatae (p) i.e. ‘a change (of feast)⁷; see on P. 26.

dapis (μὴτ the position adds to the cruelty by a kind of oxymoron. There
is a fresh (mutatae) ‘spread'(d‹1pis) every few honrs, but it kills (inemori)
instead of sustaining him, because he only sees it (spectaculo).

37. exsucta (ps), exsecta, exesa etc., ancl aridum (p): both epithets are
important, for the philtre requires (lried up organs.
