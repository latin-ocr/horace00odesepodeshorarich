Nolis longa ferae bella Numantiae
nec dirum Hannibalem nec Siculum mare

Poeno purpureum sanguine mollibus
aptari citharae modis,

nec saevos Lapithas et nimium mero 5
Hylaeum domitosque Herculea manu
Telluris iuvenes, unde periculum

fulgens contremuit domus

23. maturet perhaps has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26).

23, 24. The reading of these lines is very uncertain. If we accept Bentley³s
incomptam Lacaenae more comam relzgala nodo, then the position of Lacaenae
more almost compels us to take these words with incomptam...comam i.e. her
hair is untidy like that of a Spartan (Lacaenae is preposited) damsel, and
she is bidden to tie it up hastily in a knot (note the stress on nodo coming
last). Propertius (4) 3. 14. 28 implies that a Spartan maiden took no great care
of her coiffure. I arn assured on good feminine authority that knotting the
hair on the top is quite the quickest way of making it look ‘respectable' For
this hasty knot compare Odes 3. 14. 21, 22.

The same sense can be obtained from the reading incomptum Lacaenae
more comas relegata nodum, where comas is accusative after relzgata (middle
voice), and incomptum...nodum is an accusative of ⁶ result' or quasi-internal
and proleptic. In this reading both incomptum (ps) and nodum (placed last)
have their proper stress. On the other hand if we read z'n comptum Lacaenae
more comas relzgrata nodum, there is great stress on comptmn (ps), and we
are driven to assume that the neat knot was essentially Spartan. But there
is a further difficulty: Horace has bidden the lady to make haste and then
adds, in effect, ‘by taking time over an elaborate coiffure': indeed the words
that follow vmz‘uret form an emphatic addendum (see P. 53).

Another possibility is that comptum is a noun=‘coiffure⁷ (see Lucretius
1. 88) and that nodum is an accusative of result in apposition with comptum
and comas i.e. so as to make a knot.

XII. 1. longa...Numantiae: for the grouping see on P. 9.

2, 3. dirum (p) i.e. ‘the horrors (associated with Hannibal)' ; see on P. 27,
and on Odes 2. 14. 23. Compare also on Odes 4. 4. 49. 1f we read durum,
the position prepares us for the antithesis mollibus (ps).

Siculum (ja) amounts to ‘near Sicily' (see on Odes 1. 31. 9). Horace
passes from Spain and Italy to Sicily and its seas. Compare Odes 3. 4. 28.

mare...sanguine: for the grouping see on P. 14.

3, 4. mollibus...modis: for the grouping, with aptari intrusive‚ see on
P. 46 a. The soft measures of the lyre do not suit dura belli.

5. saevos (p) i.e. ‘the cruelties (of the Lapithae)'; see on P. 27 and on

Odes 2. 14. 23.
