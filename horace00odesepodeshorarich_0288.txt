250 HORACE

agam per altas aure sublata nives,
quaecumque praecedet fera.
tn, cum timenda voce complesti nemUS,
proiectum odoraris cibum. 10
cave, cave: namque in malos asperrimus
parata tollo cornua,
qualis Lycambae spretus infido gener
aut acer hostis Bupalo
an, siquis atro dente me petiverit, 15
inultus ut flebo puer?

VII.

Quo, quo scelesti ruitis aut cur dexteris
aptantur enses conditi?

7. per altas aure sublata nives: the grouping may be that of P. 15 ; but
the position of aure sublata between altas and nives suggests that the whole
group is connected in sense; the snow is deep and, we may assume, still
falling3 hence the dog must use ears rather than eyes.

8. quaecumque...fera: for the separation see on Odes 1. 27. 11, 12.

9. timenda (p) i.e. ‘with the terror (of your voice)’; see on P. 27. Com-
pare the position of tremendus at Odes 1. 16. 11, 4. 2. 15, 4. 6. 7, 4. 14. 12.

nemus: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

10. proiectum (μὴτ see on P. 21. The sense is ‘I go straight for my
quarry, but you—you make a great noise and then sniff the first piece of meat
thrown out.⁷ Others say that cibum is the bait thrown by the thief3 but
Horace is thinking rather of a fox or wolf that has to be driven off.

12. parata (ps) has emphasis i.e. ‘all ready’; see too P. 21.

13. Lycambae...gener: we may regard the grouping as that of P. 14.
But the words Lycambae spretus infido may be classed under P. 24, 25, and
gener may be taken as in apposition with the subject contained in spretus i.e.
the man despised as son-in-law.

14. Bupalo stands outside acer and hostis in artificial antithesis to Lycam-
bae; see on P. 47, and compare Epod. 17. 3.

15. atro (p) i.e. ‘with the venom (of his tooth)’; see on P. 27, and note at
Odes 2. 14. 23.

16. inultus ut flebo puer: the commentators say ‘The order is inultus
flebo utpuerss It is sufficient to reply that the order isn't. This much may be
urged in defence of Horace’s order: (1) that the person or thing or idea coin-
pared may precede nl (sce on Odes 1. 15. 29, and note an extreme case in Sal.
1. 3. 89 historias, capsivus ul, audit) ; but these passages merely show how
inultus ul may mean ‘as if unavenged' (conti-ast Efiad. 17. 56) or ‘as if
unable to avenge oneself‚' like contemnas:contemptiblc; (2) that itmllus
belongs equally to the subject of flebo and to puer. Such an ἀπὸ κοινοῦ use is
