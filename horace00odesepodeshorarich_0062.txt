26 HORACE

dicam et Alciden puerosque Ledae, ²5
hunc equiS, illum superare pugnis
nobilem ; quorum simul alba nautis

stella refulsit,

defluit saxis agitatus umor,
concidunt venti fugiuntque nubes, 30
et minax, quod sic voluere, ponto

unda recumbit.

Romulum post hos prius, an quietum

Pompili regnum memorem, an superbos

Tarquini fasces, dubito, an Catonis 35
nobile letum.

Regulum et Scauros animaeque magnae
prodigum Paulum superante Poeno
gratus insigni referam camena
Fabriciumque. 40

27. nobilem should have stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

alba: the adjective seems to be predicative with rqfuhil. See also on
P. 50 b. For the stella see on Odes 1. 3. 2, 3. 29. 64, and 4. 8. 31.

29. saxis is ablative partly with defluit, partly with agitatus; the water
flows down from the rocks after being broken into spray (agitatus) by the
rocks ; hence saxis stands outside agitaltes and umor. See P. 49, and the
note there on Odes 1. 2. 23.

31, 32. minax...unda recumbit: the words quod sic voluere are paren-
thetic3 therefore ponto may be felt not only with recumbit but also with
minax. The separation of minax gives it the force of a noun, as if we had
minae undarum sedzznlur3 see on P. 27.

35. Catonis stands outside nobile and letum in order, perhaps, to keep⁴
the list clear—Romulus, Numa, Tarquin, Cato. The effect of the order is
⁴ Cato and his noble death) See on P. 37 adfin„ 38, and 43. Contrast Odes
2. 1. 24 atrocem animum Catonis.

37, 38. animaeque magnae l prodigum: a Roman would read thus:
‘and the great (emphatic because postposited> soul's unstinted sacrifice of
Paulus.' The quasi-objective genitive is often preposited; see on P. 39.
This is, perhaps, why animae magnae stands outside prodzjgrum and Paulum3
see P. 43.

38. superante Poeno: a causal addendum ; see on P. 53. See too on odes
3· 1· 34·

39. gratus sc. ὤν. The adjective cquals an adve1·b; see on P. 32.

insigni (ps): we may contrast imbellis...lyme of odes 1. 6. ιο. See too
P. 21.
