262 HORACE
XIV.

Mollis inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis
oblivionem sensibus,
pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
arente fauce traxerim,
candide Maecenas, occidis saepe rogando: ·5
deus, deus narn me vetat
inceptos, olim promissum carmen, iambos
ad umbilicum adducere.
non aliter Samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo
Anacreonta Teium, ιο
qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem
non elaboratum ad pedem.
ureris ipse miser: quodsi non pulchrior ignis
accendit obsessam Ilion,

caerula (s): perhaps concessive, ‘though a sea nymph' i.e. ‘though a
demi-goddess> 3 but the adjective may be felt with domum also (see on P. 52).

18. deformis (p): see on Odes 2. 14. 233 but there is the antithesis of
dulcibus, which is itself preposited by way of contrast. The position of
dqformz's aegrimoniae (see on Ρ. 43) suggests that the two words may be
heard ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with omne malum and dulcibus czlloquz'is; compare on
Epod. 4. 9.

XIV. 1, 2. Mollis (p) i.e. ‘the softness (ofindolence)’; see on P. 27.

tantam...sensibus: for the grouping see on P. 9.

3. pocula Lethaeos...ducentia somnos: for the grouping see on P. 14.

4. arente fauce: a causal ablative absolute, ‘because my throat was dry.’

5. candide (p): see on P. 36.

6. nam is second and even third in Horace, especially when the preceding
words are emphatic3 see on Odes 1. 18. 3, and compare 4. 14. 9, Epod. 17. 45,
Sat. 2. 3. 20, 2. 3. 41, 2. 3. 302, 2. 6. 78, Epist. 2. 1. 186.

7. inceptos (ps)...prornissum (p): both participles have stress i.e. begun
but never ended, promised long ago but never carried out.

olim would normally lie between promissum and carmen, but a Roman
would probably hear it with inceptos as well as promissum. See P. 49, especially
on Odes 1. 2. 23 there quoted.

9, 10. Samio (ps)...Bathy110 Ι Anacreonta Teium: note the artificial
chiasmus. The effect os Samio (fis) is ⁴ in Samos'; sce on Odcs 1. 31. 9.

11. persaepe goes with the whole sentencc3 see on Odcs 2. 9. 13.

cava (p) testudine i.e. ‘with the hollowuess (=soundiug-board) os his
shell'3 see on P. 27.

12. non elaboratum (ps): see on P. 29. The whole line is an addendum ;
see on P. 5 3.
