132 HORACE

incontinentis nec Tityi iecur
reliquit ales, nequitiae additus
custos; amatorem trecentae
Pirithoum cohibent catenae. 80

V.

Caelo tonantem credidimus Iovem
regnare: praesens divus habebitur
Augustus adiectis Britannis
imperio gravibusque Persis.

milesne Crassi coniuge barbara 5
turpis maritus vixit et hostium
(pro curia inversique moresl)
consenuit socerorum in armis

suis (s) probably equals ‘her beloved’ (see on Odes 1. 26. 8) ; compare also
l. 65 above.

74, 75. fulmine must be read with both luridum and missos i.e. Orcus is
ghastly wan in the flash of the lightning, and the partus are sent to Orcus
by the lightning.

luridum Ι missos ad Orcum: for the grouping see on P. 21.

76. impositam...Aetnen: for the grouping see on P. 10.

77. incontinentis (p): see on odes 2. 14. 23.

Tityi (p) is logical object3 see on P. 38. Moreover the genitive may be
pendent i.e. ‘as for unchaste Tityus’; compare on P. 40.

78. ales: for its position see Odes 1. 3. 16.

79, 80. custos has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); the bird was to be gaoler,
as the chains of l. 80 were to imprison. Compare robur at Odes 2. 13. 19.

amatorem...catenae: for the grouping see on P. 9. For amatorem see on
templator 1. 71 above.

V. 1. Caelo goes first with tonantem, and then is heard again with
regnare.

2. regnare has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. is absolute monarch.

praesens (p): contrast caelo above.

4. imperio: for its position see on P. 47.

gravibus (p): see on Odes 2. 14. 23.

6. turpis (p): see on Odes 2. 14. 23.

hostiurn (ps): the genitive may be read first as possessive with the sub-
ject of the awaited verb i.e. ‘and, belonging to the enemy, at the orders os the
enemy'; ultimately it is constructed with socerorum and armis l. 8.

7. inversi (p) i.e. ‘the inversion (of morals)'; see on P. 26, but see also · Ι

P. ἢ.
38ῗ consenuit has emphasis by position i.e. ‘has actually grown old !'
