170 HORACE

vel nos in mare proximum
gemmas et lapides, aurum et inutile,
summi materiem mali,
mittamus, scelerum si bene paenitet. 50
eradenda cupidinis ’
pravi sunt elementa, et tenerae nimis
mentes asperioribus
formandae studiis. nescit equo rudis
haerere ingenuus puer 55
venarique timet, ludere doctior,
seu Graeco iubeas trocho,
seu malis vetita legibus alea,
cum periura patris fides
consortem socium fallat et hospites, 60

45. nos is emphatic because it is inserted and equ-als nos ipsi, ‘with our
own hands.' Some verb of general meaning eg. feramus is foreselt.

47. proximum: I marvel that someone has not tried to improve Horace
by emending (particular for general) to A pulicum! See on Odes 1. 1. 14.

49. summi...ma1i: for the grouping see on P. 20 a.

50. mittamus should have stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); perhaps it means
‘to turn out of the house’ as one would a divorced wife. See Terence Phorm.
4. 3. 70, and Suetonius Calzgr. 2 5.

scelerum is emphatic because it precedes si. The sense is ‘if we regret
our sins, and not our poverty only.’ This weaker meaning of paenitet is
common enough. ⁷

51. cupidinis (μὴτ passion is the vice which must be checked apuero.

52. tenerae (ps) has stress in contrast to asperioribus l. 53.

nimis (pp) has emphasis.

53. asperioribus (ps): see l. 52 above. For comparatives preposited or
separated see on P. 28, and consult also P. 24.

54. equo is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with rudis (ablative in point of which) and haerere.

55. ingenuus (ffiz contrast plebeius, agyoestis, who would have learnt to
ride and ‘rough it.'

57. Graeco (ἕως anything Greek was anathema, at any rate to the man
in the street. The Greeks were already beating Romans in the trade of the
Levant, and ‘Made in Greece' was not a popular b1·and; although, as usual,
everyone bought the articles (compare on Odes 1. 20. 2). For the order see
also P. 21.

60. consortem (p) emphasizes the fact that the partnership is one of
capital, not of friendship (hospz'lem>.

61. indigno (ps): he is piling up wealth only that his heir may have it,
and that heir worthlcss. Compare on Odcs 4. 7. 19, 20. ·
