audax omnia perpeti ι,
gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas:
audax Iapeti genus
ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit;
post ignem aetheria domo
subductum macies et nova febrium 30
terris incubuit cohors.
semotique prius tarda necessitas
leti corripuit gradum.

see P. 9. As in ll. ιο, ιι there is happy juxtaposition—the impious invade
the inviolabie, the tiny boats the dangerous shoals.

2 5. audax sc, οὖσα.

26. per vetitum (p): (breaks) through the barrier (to sin); see P. 26.

27- Iapeti (p) genus: see P. 4¹·

29- ignem aetheria: the adjective is placed in front of domo to bring
lgneus and aetheria together, as if ‘fire from heaven.’ The aether is the home
qs celestial fires.

30, 3¹· nova febrium Ι ...cohorsz sor the order with intrusive words see
on Ρ. 46 b.

32, 33. semotique prius tarda necoem'tas Ι leti: sor the grouping see on
P. ιο. Α Roman reads it thus: ‘sar-removed before and slovv, the doom os
death now hastened its steps.' The adjectives are predicative i.e. ‘though
sar-moved· and ‘though slow before)

prius: in coniunctio order with semoti and [νόω so leli with necessitas
and gradum. F or the position os the last word see on freta 1. 16 above-

34 ape-tm vacuum Daedalus aera: sor the grouping see P. 9. The
position os vacnum has point; the air was an empty ocean on which no man
m nor had been since the making os the world. The separation of aera gives
the effect of ‘and that void is air, not water.’

35. pennis-..datia an astenhought‚ as the order shows—⁴ and with wings
not to man given’; see Ρ. 53. The non qualifies homini as it should do;
English mreloesly says ‘to man not given.r

3& neruum· (p): compare Odes 2. 12. 6 Herculea manu. The adjective
Heu-uleus is preposited because it contains the real subject (see on odes
1. 15. 33), as is we had Hercules labore: or we may regard Herculeus as equal
to Herculis—a preposited genitive with the force of a nominative <see

P· 3⁸)-

37. ardui: for the separation of the partitive genitive see on Odes ι. 2 ι
