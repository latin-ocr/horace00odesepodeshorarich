58 HoRACE

XXXI.

Quid dedicatum poscit Apollinem
vates? quid orat de patera novum

fundens liquorem? non opimae
Sardiniae segetes feraces,

non aestuosae grata Calabriae 5
armenta, non aurum aut ebur Indicum,
non rura, quae Liris quieta
mordet aqua taciturnus amnis.

premant Calena falce quibus dedit
Fortuna vitem, dives ut aureis 10
mercator exsiccet culullis
vina Syra reparata merce,

properentque is short for properent properentque ; compare Odes 2. 7. 25,
2. 17. 16, 2. 19. 28, 2. 19. 32, 3. 1. 12, 3. 4. 11, 3. 11. 6, 3.21. 18, CS. 22‚Ep0d.
11. 22, and see on Odes 3. 4. 6, 7.

XXXI. 1. dedicatum (ps) perhaps means ‘because he is in his new
temple! See too P. 21.

2, 3. vates has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); as Wickham sayS‚ ‘the bard
may fitly supplicate his inspirer.⁷

novum (s): see note at Odes 1. 19. 15, and on P. 21. Here novus means
‘used for the first time ' and approaches closely to the sense of recens ; com-
pare Odes 4. 1. 32, 4. 4. 16⁷ and Epod. 5. 65.

opimae (p) i.e. ‘the bounty (of Sardinia) ’ς see on P. 27.

4. Sardiniae (p) i.e. Sardinia with its cornfield53 see on P. 38. The read-
ing opz'mas Sardiniae segetes feracis (a much more musical reading) gives
the order of P. 17.

5, 6. aestuosae-..armentat sor the grouping see on P. 9. The juxta-
position of aestuosae and grata is happy : in spite of the heat it is a pleasant
sight.

armenta should have stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26), perhaps in artificial
contrast to aurum, ebur etc.

7. quieta (ps): see on P. 21. The emphasis on quieta implies that, despite
its peaceful stream, it eats its way through. For the quiet flow of rivers on
the west of Italy see Odes 3. 29. 35, and Epod. ¹3· 13, 14.

8. taciturnus < p>1 see on quieta above. The words taciturnus amnis
form an emphatic addendum (see P. 53).

9. Calena: the adjective contains the subject, as if we had Caleni (see on
Odes 1. 15. 33). As Wickham says, ‘at Cales’ is the simple meaning. We
may compare (with Gow) Cytherea at Odes 1. 4. 5; Sabina at Odes 1. 22. 9 ;
Apulis(?> at Odes 1. 33. 7 ; Bithyna at Odes 1. 35. 7. Compare too Odes 2. 6. 3
(Maura), 2. 12. 2 (siculum), 3. 4. 28 (Sicula), 3. 14. 3 (Hispana), 4. 2. 17
