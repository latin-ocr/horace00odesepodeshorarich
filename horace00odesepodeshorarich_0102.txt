29, 30. iturum (p) i-e. ‘ (make safe) the coming journey (of Caesar) '; see
on P. 26.

in ultimos Ι orbis Britannos: for the position of this complement see on
P. 47.

iuvenum (p) i.e. ‘his warriors‚' contrast Caesarem. The words iuvenum
recens examen equal ‘the warriors in new levy'3 see on P. 38, and P. 43.
The adjective recens may be felt to qualify both iuvenum and examen (see on
Odes 1. 19. 1).

31. Eois (ps) in contrast to ultimos...Britannos. See too P. 24. The
word Eois covers the Massagetae and Arabes of l. 40.

3 3. cicatricum et sceleris: the genitives go with both elzeu and pudet.

34. fratrumque has stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26. The shame is that
brothers were fighting against each other.

dura is felt with both nos and aetas; see P. 52.

35. aetas has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘in our generations Com-
pare Livy Pref 5 5 mala quae nostra tot per annos vidit aetas.

nefasti may be genitive with quid (for its position see on Odcs ι. 2. 1) or
nominative plural, although the word is very rare of persons.

36. liquimus is read to be parallel to all the other perfects 3 but linquimus
of the MSS justifies the position (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘we are still sinners.’

manum iuventus: see on Odes 1. 2. 17.

37, 38. quibus Ι pepercit aris: for the separation of aris from quibus see
on Odes 1. 27. 11 ; aris has interest by its position: they did not spare even altars.

30, 40. retunsum (if we so read) in Ι Massagetas...ferrum: these words
ought to mean ‘the sword blunted against the Massagetae! 1f Latin order
has any significance‚ it seems impossible to take in Mfmqgetas with dtffingas
(as all commentators, ancient and modern, do, although Porphyrion says
there is ambiguity), especially in view of the fact that the words relunsum in
coalesce (compare Odes 3. 1. 5). M01·eove1·tlfflnge7‘e means only ‘to change
the form of' and is surely too strong a word sor mere sharpening (see Odes
3. 29. 47). If the sense is ‘sharpen our swords, blunted in civil war, against
