184 HORACE

addant avaro divitias mari:
tunc me biremis praesidio scaphae
tutum per Aegaeos tumultus
aura feret geminusque Pollux.

XXX.

Exegi monumentum aere perennius

regalique situ pyramidum altius,

quod non imber edaX‚ non Aquilo impotens

possit diruere aut innumerabilis

annorum series et suga temporum. 5
non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei

vitabit Libitinam: usque ego postera

crescam laude recens, dum Capitolium

58. miseras (p): the stress suggests want of dignity i.e. ‘piteous, abject‚
servile (prayers).'

59. decurrere may have stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26): the frightened
merchants rusb to prayers.

60. Cypriae (p) Tyriaeque (p): the position of the adjectives emphasizes
the value of the cargo—copper from Cyprus, purple from Tyre.

61. addant, coming early, has stress; they bring fresh wealth to a sea
already over-rich.

avaro (ps) i.e. ‘the greed (of the sea)'; see on P. 27, and compare Odes
1. 28.18 and 2. 2.1.

62-64. me...aura feret: for the order see on P. 51 ; me is also contrasted
with the other passengers.

biremis (ps) i.e. ‘with only two oars' ; see also P. 20 β.

63. tutum (s) equals an adverb, ‘in safety'; see on P. 31.

Aegaeos (p) i.e. ‘even Aegean storms¹; see on odes 1. 1. 14, 15.

64. aura may be part of the miracle and come as a paraprosdokian after
tumultus, like tange after sublimi flagello at Odes 3. 26. 11, 12. If not, aura,
despite French muge, is far too weak aster procellis and tumultus. Have we
here the azera (gleam) of Vergil Aen. 6. 204? Servius suspected it at Odcs
2. 8. 24. 1f Horace is using this aura, the reference is to the gleain os Castor
and Pollux, and aura forms with geminusque Pollux a kind of hendiadys i.e.
‘the fires oftwin Pollux’ (see on Odes 1. 3. 2); then too geminus is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ
with aura and Pollux (see on P. 33). 1f aura means ‘breeze‚' we must justify
the preposited geminus by calling it a ritual epithet (see on Odes 1. 7. 5).

XXX. 2. regali...pyramidum: for the grouping see on P. 35.

6. multaque pars mei: mulla pars may be felt as one word (see on
P. 45); but compare on P. 35. Juvenal 3. 193 tngna pat-lc sui is similar (see
Duff's note ad loa).

7, 8. usque...reeens: a Roman would read the words thus: ‘always l in
