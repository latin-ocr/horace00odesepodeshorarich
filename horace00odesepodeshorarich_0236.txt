198 HORACE

fortes creantur fortibus et bonis;
est in iuvencis, est in equis patrum 30
virtus, neque imbellem feroces
progenerant aquilae columbam: ’

doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
rectique cultus pectora roborant3
utcumque defecere mores, 35
indecorant bene nata culpae.

quid debeas, o Roma, Neronibus,
testis Metaurum flumen et Hasdrubal
devictus et pulcher fugatis
ille dies Latio tenebris, 40

qui primus alma risit adorea,
dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
ceu flamma per taedas vel Eurus
per Siculas equitavit undas.

25. sensere, quid: there is no real pause after sensere and, therefore, no
stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26).

26. faustis (ps) i.e. ‘blessed by heaven’3 the word is religious, as Wickham
points out, like penetralibus. The effect of the stress is as if one should say
‘brought up in a Christian home!

27. posset perhaps has emphasis; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

27, 28. Augusti: the genitive placed early is logical subject, as if we had
Augustus paterno...am'm0 (see P. 38). The lines speak about the relations
of Augustus with the Nerones ; Augustus very properly comes first and the
Nerones last. But both Augusti and Nerones may stand outside paternus
inpueros animus on the principle mentioned at P. 48. We need not, therefore,
regard Nerones as an emphatic addendum (P. 53).

30. patrum (p) : one may almost say that this is logical subject (see on
P. 38); in any case Horace is harping on the value os heredity. Compare the
preposited patrius of l. 5 above.

31. virtus has stress (see on odes 4. 9. 26) ; it prepares us for doclrimz of

31, 32. imbellem...columbarn: for the grouping see ou P. 8.

33. doctrina has stress because it precedes secl; contras-t virtus 1. 31·

insitam (s) i.e. provided it is there to be drawn out. See too P. 21.

34. recti (p): contrast pravi.

35. mores: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

38. Metaurum (p) is said to be a quasi-adjective. Its position is natural
enough 3 we remember ‘Boyne,' ‘Modder‚' ‘ Ma1·ne‚' and ‘river’ is of secondary
importance.

39, 4ο. pulcher fugatis...dies...tenebris: sor the grouping see on P. c).
