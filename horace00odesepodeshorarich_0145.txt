¹⁴· renutat is followed by a future diventa compare Odes 3. 3. 7, 8.

centimanus (p) i.e. ‘the hundred hands (of Gyas)’; see on P. 27.

to describe a fearsorne thing; compare on odes 3. 17. 3. See too P. 21.

18, 19. pan violentior Ι natalis horae: the grouping is rare (see on P. 44,
45). 11 is just possible that pars violentior, like pars tertia etc.‚ may be felt
as one word.

natalia (p): in Horace this word is always preposhed, as it is, with some-
what rare exceptions‚ in all Latin where the words hora and tempus occur.

19, 20. tyrannus is a quasi-adjective (τυραννεύων), as at odes 3. 17. 9;
the grouping tyrannus...undae is therefore that of P. 9.

as a pair, says Horace, through life, and beyond.

incredibili (p) has emphasis.

22. astrum: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

te lovis impio: note the early grouping of case relations (see on Odes

te: for its position see on P. 51. 11 is also in contr-ast to meos l. 27.

Iovia(p): see on P. 38.

22, 23. ἰωρίο...1εἱιΰςωεε for the grouping see on P. 27.

smum goes first with refulgens and then with eripuit.

24, ²5. volueritque-..alam for the grouping with the intrusive verb see
on P. 4⁶0.

26. laetum (ps) is in effect an emphatic adverb (see on 1‘. 3¹)- Α Roman
would read thus: ‘the thronging populace all joyously in the theatre....'
