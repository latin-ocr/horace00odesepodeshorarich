Epona 5 2⁴7

atqui nec herba nec latens in asperis
radix fefellit me locis:
indormit unctis omnium cubilibus
oblivione paelicum. 50
a a, solutus ambulat veneficae
scientioris carmine.
non usitatis, Vere. potionibus,
o multa fleturum caput.
ad me recurres, nec vocata rnens tua ῃ,
Marsis redibit vocibus;
maius parab0‚ maius infundam tibi

fastidienti poculum,

pause at the end οἰ the line makes it unnecessary to group novam incendio
nuptam together (see on P. 5ο b).

There is a varia lectr'o viz. nova, and one is ternpted to wonder whether
Horace wrote novo (dread, horrible)‚ felt with both mbo and incendio. The
latter word seems to require some epithet, and the separation of novam from
neeptanae has little point, unless it is intended to heighten the pathos or to
emphasize the meanness of taking another wife.

67, 68. latens in asperis Ι radix...locis: for the grouping see on Ρ. 9. The
phrase latens in asperis is concessive i.e. ⁸ though hidden and hard to reachst

69, 7ο. unctis...paelicum: the phrase unctis omnium cubilibus oblivione
i.e. ‘on couches anointed with sorgetsulness of all¹ is normal enough in its
order (see on P. ⁴8)· The third complement paelicum may also stand outside
unctu& and cubilibus, but possibly it carries some stress of bitterness.

71. veneficae (p) i.e. by the charrn of a sellow·prty‘esst'onal and one more
skiued. The genitive is of greater importance than the noun on which it de·
pends3 see on P. 38.

73. non usitatis (ps): see on P. 29, and compare Odes 2. 20. 1. For the
intervening vocative see on Odes 1. 5. 3.

74. mum goes closely with fleturum (πολυδάκρυτον); compare Epod.
3. 1 3 hoc delibutis.

fleturum (p): see on P. 36.

75. vocata mens tua: for the grouping see on P. 34

76. Marsis (βῆς the hlarsians were famous sor sorcery; even theirenchant-
ments vin not avail in this case. Compare Colchicis (s) l. 24 above. and
Epod. 17. 28, 29, 17. 35, 17. 60. Αάἀ Odcs 1. 27. 21 Thessalis margus venenis.
See also Ρ. 21.

The words Marsis vocibus are heard with both vocam and redibit, for
redibit is equivalent to reseretur (sc. ad te or ad me). Compare C icero lt’osc.
A mer. 44. 128, and Ovid Her. 20. ¹72 where redit-redditur.

77. maius parabo: donabile-ss, as Wickham says, this first majus is quite
vague (sc. quiddam), but so is the second maius until the word poculum is
heard. Possibly one may scel poculum as object offitstide'ctm' also.
