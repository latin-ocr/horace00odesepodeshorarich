time to come shall grow in praise ever fresh'; i.e. lancie belongs partly to
crescam, partly to recens.

usque is emphatic by separation from crescam.

postera (ps) i.e. ‘in the future,' though, at present, 1 may be of little
account. See too P. 21.

crescam coming early probably has stress i.e. crescam, non mt'nuar.

reeens is an emphatic addendum (see on Ρ. 53) i.e. ‘as if just published’;
contrast novus ‘never before existent.'

9. taeit- (p) : the stress on the epithet perhaps suggests to the mind the
solemn silence which reigned during religious ceremonials; compare favete
Ir'ngm’s and σῦφημεὶπ. Perhaps, too, Vestals were ceremonially dumb when
they came out of the seclusion of the Atrium Vestae.

to. violens (ps): like longe sonantem of Odes 4. 9. 2, the epithet describes
that part of the river nearest Venusia. The Aufidus would be noisy in the
hills, but not in the plain. See also P. 21.

qua...obstrepit: these words ought to go with dican if they went with
princeps deduxisse, we should have obstrepat. If Shakespeare had said ‘men
will ever talk os me at stratford: he would not be belittling himself: he would
merely imply that all the world was going to visit his birth-place as if some
sacred shrine.

¹1, 12. agrestium (ps): Horace is speaking of Apulia Daunia in the
north (contrast Venusia in the south), and these Daunii would be pastoralists
(agrestes) os the plains opposed to the mountaineers of Venusia and of the
upper Aufidus. See also P. 21.

12-14. ex humili potens Ι princeps...deduxisse: the construction seems
to be ⁸(1 shall be spoken of where...) as being α humili potens and princeps...
daha-me) But see the editors.

Aeolium (p) prepares us for the antithesis Italos (ps). See on Odes
1. 26. 11 Lesbio (μὴτ see also P. 21.

15. mer-itis has stress; it should lie between superbiam and quaesitam.
See on Ρ. 49.

mihi equals ‘if you please’; it is a quasi-ethica! dative and therefore
comes early. as so often. Compare Greek καί μοι xa& rr)- μαρτυρίαν.

Delphica (p) i.e. not the laurel of victory in war, not Partha-«1, Italica,
samarita etc„ but Delphica. Compare Apollinari (s) at Odes 4. 2. 9, and
contrast Delfis...solr'is at Odes 4. 3. 6.
