54 HORACE

dant alios Furiae torvo spectacula Marti,
exitio est avidum mare nautis;
mixta senum ac iuvenum densentur funera, nullum
saeva caput Proserpina fugit. πο
me quoque devexi rapidus comes Orionis
Illyricis Notus obruit undis.
at tu, nauta, vagae ne parce malignus harenae
ossibus et capiti inhumato

16. leti may stand outside calcanda...via on the principle noted at P. 48,
or because via leti is treated as one word—‘Death road‚' as Livy 34. 9. 6 has
pars tertia civium. See also on P. 45. So far I assume that manet is to be
supplied with calcanda semel via3 but if with calcanda we may supply est,
then semel, because postposited‚ is emphatic, and the una of l. 15 has suess,
i.e. the road must be trodden once and once only3 one night and one night
only awaits all 3 the stories of reincarnation are mere nonsense.

17. torvo spectacula Marti: spectacula is a poetic equivalent of spectanda,
and thus torvo...Martz· comes under P. 21.

18. avidum (p) i.e. ‘the hunger (of the sea)⁷; see on P. 27, and compare .

Odes 2. 2. 1, 2, 3. 29. 61.

19. mixta...funera: for the intrusive densentur see on P. 46a. The in—
sertion of densentur emphasizes the idea of mixta, somewhat like opulenta at
Odes 1. 17. 16.

nullum has stress standing alone at the end of the line.

19, 20. nullum Ι saeva caput Proserpina: for the grouping see on P. 9.

21. me quoque must, so it seems to me, be antithetical to the te of l. 1.
The interposition of ll. 19, 20 makes it unlikely that me quoque should
refer to nautis of l. 18. The position of me is not necessarily due to the
principle noted at P. 51, for, in all Latin, names of natural phenomena may
be subjects to transitive verbs without any divergence from the normal
order.

devexi...0rionis: sor the grouping see on P. 10. For ‘ setting Orion’ see
Odes 3. 27. 18.

22. Illyricis ( ps) Notus: these words are kept together because a south
wind would drive the sailor from his due east course set to Corcyra (or from
the more northern course to Dyrrhachium) on to the dangerous islands of the
Illyrian coast.

23. at tu: here the ghost suddenly sees and hails a passing boat.

vagae (ps): the sand is scattered everywhere and therefore costs nothing.
The case os vagae is dative with parce, genitive ‘in point of which' with
malzgnus, and genitive of definition with particulam. Compare Liburnis,
Odes 1. 37. 30, Afris 2. 1. 26, tibi 2. 8. 1, votis 2. 8. 6, consiliis 2. 11. 12,
monstris 3. 4. 73, bobus 3. 6. 43, tibi 3. 7. 22, sibi 3. 8. 19, 20, silai 3. 27. 71,
and Peliae in Ovid Her. 12. 129 Quid reseram Peliae natas pietate nocentes
(where Peliae is genitive with natas and dative with nocentes).
