XII.

Iam veris comites, quae mare temperant,

impellunt animae lintea Thraciae;

iam nec prata rigent, nec fluvii strepunt
hiberna nive turgidi.

nidum ponit, Ityn flebiliter gemens,

infelix avis et Cecropiae domus

aeternum opprobrium, quod male barbaras
regum est ulta libidines.

dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium
custodes ovium carmina fistula ιο

delectantque deum, cui pecus et nigri
colles Arcadiae placent.

adduxere sitim tempora, Vergili;

sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum

si gestis, iuvenum nobilium cliens, 15
nardo vina merebere.

XII. 1. veris is preposited because it indicates the topic of the stanza.
Compare too hiberna (p) of 1. 4.

2. Thraciae (s) i.e. ‘from Thrace’ i.e. (see Gow) ‘from the West.' See on
Odes 1. 31. 9.

4. hiberna nive turgidi: the group is a causal addendum (see P. 53).

hiberna (p): contrast veris (p) of l. 1.

6. infelix (p) echoesflebz'liter.

Cecropiae domus: these words precede aeternum opprobrium with point.
The crime was almost as much a disgrace to Procne's side of the family as
to Thracian Tereus. See too Ρ. 43.

7, 8. aeternum (p) has stress i.e. ‘for ever and for ever.' Compare on
Odes 2. 1. 15.

male might be read first with barbaras, and then later, emphasized by
separation, with est ulla.

barbaras...libidines: for the grouping and intrusive verb see on P. 46 a.

9, 10. tenero (p)...pinguiurn (ps): the preposited adjectives heighten the
picture of soft grass and fat sheep.

pinguium Ι custodes ovium: for the grouping see on P. 20 a.

11, 12. nigri Ι colles Arcadiae: for the order see on P. 35. The sti-ess on
nigri(p) may signify ‘the shadow (of trees on the hills)⁷; see on P. 27. There
is a reading nzjgrae colles Arcadiae (see P. 20 a); this nigrae would assuredly
be ‘corrected' to agree with colles.

14. pressum...Liberum: sor the ordei· with intrusivc ducere see on P. 46α.
But pressum Calibus deserves stress. The wine was a famous one, and the
sense is ‘if it is champagne you are wanting)
