simplices Nymphae, ferus et Cupido

semper ardentis acuens sagittas . 5
cote cruenta.

adde quod pube· tibi crescit omnis,
servitus crescit nova, nec priores
impiae tectum dominae relinquunt,
saepe minati. ιο
te suis matres metuunt iuvencis,
te senes parci. miseraeque nuper
virgines nuptae, tua ne retardet
aura maritos.

matria (p) i.e. even a mother's ashes. But see also P. 35.

1ο, 11. toto taciturna...signa cum eaelo: for the grouping see on P. ιο.

11, 12. gelidaque-„menti” for the grouping see on P. 17.

14. simplice· (p) i.e. ‘for all their simplicity' (Wicltharn); contrastserus
(p) ‘fier-ce and rough)

15. semper seems to belong to serus as well as to acuens3 it therefore has
emphasis by separation fmrn both words.

udentia (ps) is usually taken to mean ‘buming (arrows)’ ; but if ‘buming'
be taken in a litera! sense the picture is unsatisfactory. To my ear ardentis
is proleptic (see on P. 30) and one may compare Odes 3. 20. ιο dentes acuit

⁷ emendos. We may therefore choose between (1) ‘till the points send out

sparus· (2) ‘to make them sting,’ as is we had urentes. The word ardere, in
poetry,might easily pass into the sense of ‘stinging’; compare caecus=making
one blind, and ‘diay precipices,’ ‘sleeping beds’ etc. For the order, however,
see P. 21.

16. eote emente is an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53) i.e. ‘and on
a whetstone stained with blood.’ His arrows are stained with the blood of
honrly victims and have stained the whetstone itself.

17. mnis (postposited and separated) means ‘yes, all of it.’

18. nova (s)-‘and those never before existent‚’ ‘an altogether new lot’ in
colloquial English. Moreover as novus is usually prepossted, it here acquires
added emphasis (see on Odes 1. 2. 6).

19. impiae tectum dorninae: for the grouping see on P. zoa. The force
ostrapius (ps) is ⁸ though faithless) The word pius signifies ‘loyal affection‘ ς
when used of women it amounts to pudicus. Compare Ovid Her. ¹3· 78,
14. 49, 14. 64, and note 1. 85 ille tamen pietate mea precibusque pudicis l
frangitur.

20. nepe unmti is an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53) i.e. ‘for all
their threnis!

2¹. te mi· mes: note the early grouping of case relations (see on (Mes
1. 2. 17). lt should be observed that suis may be felt as a substantive and
