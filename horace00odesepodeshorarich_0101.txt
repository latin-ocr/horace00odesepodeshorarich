omis 1. 35 ⁶5

te Spes et albo rara Fides coiit
velata panno nec comitem abnegat,
utcumque mutata potentis
veste domos inimica linquis.

at vulgus infidum et meretrix retro ²5
periura cedit. diffugiunt cadis
cum faece siccatis amici,
serre iugum pariter dolosi.

merely to carry out the bidding (ser-va) os Fortuna. is it is true that slaves
ordinarily went behind, the fact only gives more point to ser-va. Compare
colit at 1. 21 below.

¹9· aena (s): this order helps to enforce the point of severus (p). We
have a chiasmus manu...aena and severus Ι uncus. See also P. 21.

oevemn mans inherently ‘fixed‚’ ‘rigid.’ Thus, in Lucretius 5. ¹¹90.
,τέρεα severa probably signifies the fixed, unchanging consteilations.

20 liquidum (p) is in somewhat artificia! antithesis to severus—liquid
versus solid.

21, 22. tespoe: see on 1. 5. For the interpretation of 11. 21-28 see Appendix
at the end os this Ode.

albo rara Fide-...panum sor the grouping see on P. ιο.

ran nde-...velatu for this grouping see on P. 34 Wickham says that
rara means ⁸ rarely found’; but the combination albo rara panno suggests
the 111111 vei} of Fides (see on Odes 1. 18. 16, and compare the rara tunt'ca os
ovid Amor. 1. 5. 13); and in 311 other passages of Horacepannus 1135 3 con·
temptuous subaudition which 111 accords with any compiimentary meaning
os rara.

²3· mutata potentis Ι veste domos: sor the grouping see on P. 9. To
my mind the order makes it imperative to take mutata veste with potentis
don-os. Α Roman on reading the words neutata potentis· veste must feel
poteram subject, as it were, os mutata (see on Odes 1. 10. ¹⁴)· Moreover the
juxtaposition of mutata potentis sounds like ‘there is change sor the powersu1,'
and we need not find a difficulty in the fact 11131, when we reach linquis.
potentianae πρότερον κρατοῦντας. Τ1115 clears away the scruples of Wickham,
who refers mutata veste to Fortune.

25. reu-o (s) has emphasis.

26. periura (s) equals ‘saithlessly'; see on P. 3¹·

(vulgus) oedit, diffugiunt...amici: note the chiasmus; the vulgus sall
back, but andei scatter 111 every direction.

28. ‘erremdoloeiz these words are a causa} addendum: see on P.

pariter postposited and separated draws attention to the real point i.e.
‘equaliy’: some friends might go in harness with you. but, to use the language
uf rowing, would ‘sugat' and shirk their share of the work.
