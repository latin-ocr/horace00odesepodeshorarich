ODES Ι, 25-26 49

xxvi.

Musis amicus tristitiam et metus
tradam protervis in mare Creticum
portare ventis, quis sub Arcto
rex gelidae metuatur orae,

quid Tiridaten terreat, unice 3
securus, o quae sontibus integris
gaudes, apricos necte flores,
necte meo Lamiae coronam,

18. pulla (μὴτ the order may be partly due to chiasmus (compare. sor
instance, Odts 2. 3. 9), partly to a desire to suggest that bright green ivy is
best, and even (atque) dull green myrtle is preferable to dry leaves. ln this
case magis by its position equals ‘far more’ (compare 1. ιι above) and
qualifies hedera gaudeat and gaudeat myrto alike. But the hyperbaton is
very harsh and has no parallel in the Odes and Epodes.

The order would be more tolerable if atque were taken in the sense of
‘than’ (see on epod. 12. 14). Green ivy may symbolize youth ; dark myrtle
middle lisez dry leaves old age. Thus we might translate by ‘because gladly
youth revels in green ivy, rather than in dusky myrtle; while withered leaves
it dedicantes...)

19, 2ο. aridas (p): contrast vindis. Note the chiasmus hedera virenti...
andasfiondes.

hiemis (p): the sere„ and yellow leaf goes, naturally, to wr'nter's comrade-
the Hebrus. See on P. 43, if sodali be felt as quasi-adjectival.

sodali Ι dedicet Hebro: the order is a slight extension of the type noted
at P. 21. The Hebrus suits Thracio of l. 11 above. Gow reads Euro.

xxvl. 2. protervis (ps): i.e. ‘to the wildness (of the winds)’; see on
P. 27. ’Πιε order prepares us sor the wildness of the Cretan sea. See on
odes 1. 35. 7.

4. rex by position equals ‘as king’; but see on Odes 1. 27. 11, 12.

gelidae (ps) echoes sub Arcto. The order gelidae metuatur orae suggests
unt gelidae orae belongs first to rex and then, as dative of the agent, to
metuatur (see P. 21, 22, 23).

6, 7. securus and gaudee have emphasis-»3 see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

⁸960oe (μιῆς see on P. 21. Horace passes from chill sear and terrors of
the north to sunny elimes and flowers.

8. meo (p) either equals ‘my own beloved' or ‘to pleasure me.¹ For the
former compare Cicero Verr. 4. 1. 3 apud tuos Mamertion Livy 1. 16. 7 naeu
Romen Catullus 3. 3 etc. meae puellam Vergil Ecl. 3. 68 parta meae Veneri
sunt manerem Odes 1. 22. ιο, 3. 3. 13(?), 3. 3. 66, 3. 4. 73. ⁴- 5. 5. 4. 8. 2.
4 11. 31, 320), 4. 15. 60). Epod. 13. 6. For the last, where meo is equis-alem
to nerui—an ethica! dative—see on odes ι. 1 3. 3.
