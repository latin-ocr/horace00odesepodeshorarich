13. confite-que goes with lieris as well as silvas: see on P. 33.

15, 16. immanis must, l think, belong to ianitor and equal ‘for all his
monstrous might) The words tinnitor aulae form a compound—‘doorkeeper'
(compare Tennyson’s ‘silent Opener os the Gate’). lt is hard to see how the
phrase ‘monstrous doorlceeper‚’ aster the mention of Amphion, could be
understood οἱ any doorkeeper save Cerberus, but, is we accept Bentley's
:teneque in l. 18, there is nothing not Horatian about the next stanta- On the
other hand if immanis· is taken with aulae, there is no parallel to such a
pointless separation of the adjective3 and, seeing that immanis is so obscure
in form (there is nothing to suggest that it is either genitive or feminine), we
are compelled to think os it as subject to cessit. Contrast grato in l. 23
below.

17, 18. funale...caput: sor the grouping see on P. 8.

2ο. ore trilingui: this is not necessarily an emphatic addendum (see on
P. 53), for we still await the source from which the blood drips.

22. invito (s): as if we had invitus i.e. ‘and that too against his will’; but
see on P. 21.

stetit is put early sor emphasis; usually the Danaides were running with
the vessel.

22, 23. paulum is in ἀπὸ κοινοῦ position with stetit and u'cca.

sioe· has stress i.e. ‘actually dry l’; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

23, 24. mto...cannine: the grouping is as if we had Danas· puellis,
dative with grato.

Danai puellas-Danas‘das5 hence Danas· is preposited. See on Ρ. 41.

27. per-matis is musal by position i.e. ‘since it runs through)

imo (s): see on P. 21.
