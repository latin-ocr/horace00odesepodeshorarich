ODES ιν, ις ²27

nosque et profestis lucibus et sacris ‚3
inter iocosi munera Liberi,
cum prole matronisque nostris
rite deos prius adprecati,

virtute functos more patrum duces
Lydis remixto carmine tibiis 30
Troiamque et Anchisen et almae
progeniem Veneris canemus.

28. rite (s) perhaps has sti-estu but Horace may have wished ιο keep two
adverbs spart.

29. virtute functos more potrum duces: certain editors say that more
patrum goes with canemus. is this is true, then any order will do for poetry‚
and no deductions from order are possible. What is wrong with ⁴ leaders who
have done their duty as their fathers did before them’? We have two com·
piemems‚ virtute and more patr-unu the former stands outside fitnctos and
abu-es (see on P. 48).

30. Lydi-...eibum sor the grouping see on P. io.

3¹» 3²· almae Ι progniem Veneris: for the grouping see on P. 20 β.
