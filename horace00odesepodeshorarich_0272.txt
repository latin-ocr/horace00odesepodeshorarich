234 HORACE ’

roges, tuum laborem quid iuvem meo, 15
imbellis ac firmus parum?
comes minore sum futurus in metu,
qui maior absentis habet:
ut assidens implumibus pullis avis
serpentium allapsus timet 20
magis relictis, non, ut adsit, auxili
latura plus praesentibus,
libenter hoc et omne militabitur
bellurn in tuae spem gratiae,
non ut iuvencis illigata pluribus ²5
aratra nitantur meis,
pecusve Calabris ante ‘sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascuis,

15. tuum (p) laborem: contrast meo alone at the end of the line. If we
read labore, then meo has stress by separation in contrast to tuum alone at
the beginning of the clause.

16. parum (pp) is emphatic.

17. minore (s): the position prepares us for maior of the next line.

19. assidens...avis: for the grouping compare on P. 10.

implumibus (p) i.e. ‘ because featherless.’

20. serpentium (p) i.e. ‘snakes (and their approach)⁷; see on P. 38.

21, 22. magis relictis is an addendum (see on P. 53> i.e. ‘but more when
she has left them'3 the position of the words prepares us for the antithesis
praesentibus.

auxili (μὴτ see on P. 38, and especially on Odes 1. 2. 1. Prose would have
plus latura auxili ordinarily.

plus (pps) has stress.

23. libenter first and separated from militabitur has stress ; compare satis
superque l. 31 below.

omne (s) has emphasis. See also P. 21.

24. tuae spem gratiae: for the grouping see on P. 20 α.

25. pluribus (pps) has emphasis, for comparatives are usually preposited
(see P. 28), and so are adjectives os quantity. But see too P. 24.

26. meis (s) has great stress‚ the oxen are mine, not the property of a
landlord or the result of borrowing. Compare proprio, patrios at Odes
1. 1. 9, 1. 1. 11, and suis at Epod. 2. 3. There is a reading mea, for which see
on P. 21.

27. Calabris (ps) prepares us for the antithesis Lucana. It probably is
read as ‘in Calabria' (see on odes 1. 31. 9).

28. pascuis: there is a variant pascua (see on Ι). 21) which would give
stress to Lucana in contrast to Calabris.

29. superni villa candens Tusculi: for the grouping see on P. 15. Surely
