9, 10. Caecubum...tu: the object comes first with emphasis; it is a first
class wine.

prelo domitam Caleno Ι ...uvam: for the grouping see on P. 14.

Caleno (s): its position emphasizes the high quality of the wine.

tu is emphatic because inserted ; contrast mea (ps), whose position seems
to support the reading tu. '

bibes may be a conative future i.e. ‘you will be for drinking' (compare on
Odes 1. 15. 18). See however Mr L. H. Allen’s paper GR. Vol. xxv. p. 168.
Gow, GR. XXIX. p. 76, shows good reason for reading iubes (‘you order up’).

mea (ps): see above on tu. The possessive adjective merely sounds like
‘ as for me‚’ and is equivalent to an ethical dative. See note on Odes 1. 13. 3.

10, 11. Falernae (ps): the position emphasizes (like Caleno above) the
excellence of the wine; compare Odes 3. 1. 43, but see P. 21.

Formiani (ps): for its position compare Falernae above.

XXI. 1, 2. Dianam: note the chiasmus Dianam. ..elicita ..dicite Cynthium.

tenerae (ps) i.e. because you are tendet (sing to the tender maiden
goddess„ compare on Odes 1. 1. 26, but see also P. 21.

intonsum (ps): Horace wishes to keep the adjective close to pueri i.e. the
unshorn god (‘ unshorn⁷ implies young) is to be worshipped by the young.

3, 4. Latonamque supremo Ι dilectam...10vi: for the grouping see P. 14.

penitus, placed after dilectam, has emphasis.

5. nemorum (p) i.e. ‘the groves (with their tresses of leaves)’; see on
P. 38, and on Odes 1. 1. 30.

6. gelido (ps) i.e. ‘the snows (of Algidus)’; see on P. 27 and P. 21. For
the phrase see Odes 3. 23. 9.

7. aut is placed before Erymanthi, not before nigris, because the names
of the mountains are the ideas really connected together. See also note on
viridis (p) in l. 8.

8. viridis (p): contrast the dark foliage (pines, liolm-oaks etc.) of Ery·
manthus.
