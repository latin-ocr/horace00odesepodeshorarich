208 ’ HORACE

frigora mitescunt Zephyris, ver proterit aestas
interitura, simul v 10
pomifer autumnus fruges effuderit, et mox
bruma recurrit iners.
damna tamen celeres reparant caelestia lunae:
nos, ubi decidimus,
quo pius Aeneas, quo Tullus dives et Ancus, 15
pulvis et umbra sumus
quis scit an adiciant hodiernae crastina summae
tempora di superi?
cuncta manus avidas fugient heredis, amico
quae dederis animo. 20
cum semel occideris et de te splendida Minos
fecerit arbitria,
non, Torquate, genus, non te facundia, non te

restituet pietas:

9. Zephyris: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

10. interitura has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘only to die.' See Odes
1. 28. ὁ.

11. pomifer i.e. ‘the apple-bearing (of Autumn)'; see on P. 27.

12. iners goes with recurrit i‚e. speeds back only to bring torpidity ; com-
parepz'grz's (ps) at Odes 1. 22. 17. The picture is, perhaps, of a runner falling
inert from exhaustion.

13. damna...lunae: for the grouping see on P. 13.

14. nos is emphatic because inserted i.e. ‘but we,’ contrast lunae.

15. quo pius (p>: pius seems to be a better reading than pater. The
preposited pius has point, like the dives (p) of many MSS, i.e. ‘whither
Aeneas sor all his pz'ety and patriotz'sm, and Tullus despite llis wealtlz...’
(compare pudicum of 1. 25 below). If we read Tullus dives, dives may be
ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with Tullus and Ancus (see too Juvenal 5. 57).

17, 18. hodiernae...ternpora: for the grouping see on P. 9.

19, 20. heredis is out of place for emphasis (see on P. 44) i.e. everything
will escape from the greedy hands of your lzez'r5 lte will squander it in spite
os all your saving.

amico (ps) should have emphasis. Why can it not mean ‘in spite of your
lcimlliest z'nlenlions in leaving your estate to him'? But see. the editors.

animo: for its position see Odes 1. 3. 16.

21. de te is put early on purpose; it is the argumentum ad hominem.
For the same reason le comes early twice in 1. 23.

splendida (ps): the adjective colours both Asinos and arbitria (see on
P . 52); Minos in state will give stately decisions.

22. arbitria: forits position sce (hies 1. 3. 16.
