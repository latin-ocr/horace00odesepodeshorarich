infernis neque enim tenebris Diana pudicum ²3
liberat Hippolytum,

nec Lethaea valet Theseus abrumpere caro
vincula Pirithoo.

VIII.

Donarem pateras grataque commodus,

Censorine, meis aera sodalibus.

donarem tripodas, praemia sortium

Graiorum, neque tu pessuma munerum

serra, divite me scilicet artium, 5
quas aut Parrhasius protulit aut Scopas,

hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus

sollers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.

sed non haec mihi viS, non tibi talium

τω est aut animus deliciarum egens, >¹ ιο

23. temte: seeon l. 21 above, and also on P. 5¹·

25. inlunis (μὴτ ‘of hell' is the point.

pudicum (ρης ‘sor all his purity) Compare pius (p) and dives (p ?) os
l. ¹5. See too P. 21.

27, 28. Lethaea...enso Ι vincula Pirithoo: for the stress on Lethaea by
separation compare infernis (ps) in l. 2 5, and for the grouping see P. 9.

vlu. 1. Μ putaque commodus: a Roman would read thus: ‘cups
and things pleasing because 1 am anxious to please (commodus ὅν)’; then in
the next line grata is defined by aera i.e. ‘even bronzesst For the sentiment
of grata commodus compare Ovid Her. 17. 71 acceptu-sima semper Ι munera
sant, auctor quae pretiosa facit. It is the opposite os ‘Rich gifts wax poor
when givers prove unkind.'

2. meis (ps) i.e. ‘my loved (comrades)’; see on odes 1. 26. 8.

3. fortium (p) i.e. ‘(rewards) of bravery’; see on P. 27. The large number
of rhymes 111 this doubtful Ode is surprising; note—mn ll. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 2 5,
26, and—ae ll. ις,16,17.

4. Graiorum should have stress (see on Odes 4 9. 26>; perhaps the word
‘Greeks’ suggests Greek workmanshiss and therefore objects of great artistic
value-

5. {erre should have stt-ess (see on Odes 4. 9. 26); its sense is ‘carry off
{reely as your spoil)

&vite me seilicet i-e. ‘if 1, os 311 people in the world, were rich in...’;
scillcet seems to be little more than δὴ, and to signisy ‘what a notion 1'

7. liquidis (ps) is brought close to its antithesis saxo.

9, 10. non haee is predicative i.e. ‘not in this direction lies my vis!

talium maletida-um egem: sor the grouping see on P. 17.
