16 HORACE

quis Martem tunica tectum adamantina

digne scripserit aut pulvere Troico

nigrum Merionem aut ope Palladis ι 5
Tydiden superis parem?

nos convivia, nos proelia virginum
sectis in iuvenes unguibus acrium
cantamus vacui, sive quid urimur,
non praeter solitum leves. 20

VII.

Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon aut Mytilenen
aut Epheson bimarisve Corinthi

moenia vel Baccho Thebas vel Apolline Delphos
insignis aut Thessala Tempe3

lyrae (p): the lyric is contrasted with the epifi of l. 2 above. The genitive
lyrae depends partly on Musa, partly on potens. Compare maris odes 1. 5. 16

ἃῃᾱιῗθεζζεὲἰίζᾶῗρῂ peerless. The adjective is naturally emphasised to flatter

Caesar (cp. odes 3. 25. 4, and see on Odes 3. 27. 73).

12. ingeni (s): ability is the point3 I should fail not from lack of effort or
of desire, but of power and aptitude.

13. Martem  adamantina: sor the grouping see P. 16.

14, 15. pulvere...Merionem: normally pulvere Troico would lie between
mgrum and Merz'onem, but Horace, perhaps wishes to mention the Trojan
war early. See P. 49.

15, 16. ope Palladis...parem: for the second complement outside see P.48.

17. nos convivia, nos proelia: for early grouping of case relations see on
Odes 1. 2. 17. There is, of course, emphasis on nos because the pronoun is
inserted.

19. vacui is an afterthought (see P. 53>= ‘that is when we are heart-whole.'
It is usual to supply cantamus with leves and to translate non praeter as if
secundum but it is just possible that leves may be a verb i.e. ‘one would not
raise me above my wont.' In any case the sense must be ‘my forte is to
sing of dinners and flirting when my heart is free, and, if1 am in love, you
will still find me playsul and frivolous' 3 i.e. I have not the gravitas needful
for the epic style. For seu=or if, and if, see Odes 3. 4. 22.

VII. 1, 2. alii: the position gives the effect of οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι i.e. ‘others
may...but 1 (ἐγὼ &off—the me of l. 10 below) will praise 'sibun'

claram (p) i.e. ‘the fame or, possibly, sunshine (of Rhodes)'; bimaris (p)
i.e. ‘the twin seas (of Corinth)'; see P. 27. We may, however, consider the
adjectives as predicative i.e. ‘will praise as famous, as bimarem.’

2, 3. Corinthi (p) Ι moenia i.e. ‘Corinth with its walls'; see on P. 38.

moenia should have stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.
