picture—the tensa! widow os the warrior-and thus the position os ve may
be justified. We have passed from immin to θρῆνοι, and, appropriateiy, the
first word we hear is flebili (p) i.e. ‘tears (of a widow).'

plorat has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26) and echoesflebili (p).

23. aureo· goes with educit proleptically (see on P. 30), and its sense is
echoed by in astra.

nigro (ps): contrast aureo-n but see also P. 21.

25. multa...cycnum: sor the grouping see on P. 7.

26. tendit has emphasis because it precedes quotiens i.e. ‘strains all his
powers-⁸ Compare Imbres l. 5 above. and see Odes 4. 9. 28. Epod. 1. 9, ια
and Odes ι. 37. 2ο.

27. ego is emphatic because inserted: contrast Pindar.

P. 21.

pet laborem is an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53), and equals idque
per laborem. Horace implies that Pindar writes with the ease os a great
inspiration, whereas he himself is compelled to work ; hisselicr'tas is cun'osa
indeed. As if to make the point more obvious still, he adds plurimum (pp)
in a position of emphasis (see on Odes 4. 9. 36), and at 1. 3¹ speaks os his
carmina as operosa (ps).

3ο, 31. uvidi (p) i.e. ‘the falls (of Tibur)'; see on P. 27, and compare Odts
3. 29. 6 udum« (p) Tibur.
