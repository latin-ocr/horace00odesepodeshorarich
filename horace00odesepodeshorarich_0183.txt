ODES 111, 9-10 ¹45

ingratam Veneri pone superbiam.
ne currente retro funis eat rota: ιο
11011 te Penelopen difficilem procis

Tyrrhenus genuit parens.

o quamvis neque te munera nec preces

nec tinctus viola pallor amantium

nec vir Pieria paelice saucius 15
curvat, supplicibus tuis

parcas, nec rigida mollior aesculo
nec Mauris animum mitior anguibus,
non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae
caelestis patiens latus. ιο

7, 8. ventis} the objections to this rading are clearly stated by Bentley.
Another objection is the position of ventis (see on Odes 4. 9. 26). The zeugma
of auds's...ut glacia is unparalleled for harshness. The audire of Odes 2. 1. 21
13 not similar, nor 13 it quite relevant to quote Aen. 4. 490 mugire m'dtbis Ι sub
pedibus terrane, since you can see, as well as hear, an earthqunke : in any case
videre equals both to see with the eye and to perceive with the mind (com-
pare odes 1. 14. 3-6, and Prop. 2. 16. 49). l should therefore vote sor sentis,
with a comma after remugiat. See on ramis, Odqs 2. 3. 11.

positas (ps): fallen snow under a clear frosty (puro preposited) sky is a
much colder proposition than falling snow.

9. ingratam Veneri: the words are causal (ἄη ἀηδῆ οὖσαν), hence their
position ς see too P. 46 a.

10. retro, as Wickham says, is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with cur-rente and simis eat.
That the order 13 intentional is obvious enough; for Horace could easily have
interchanged retro and rota. The separation of currente retro from rota
makes the first two words causal (compare ingratam Veram· above) i.e. because
the wheel runs back, the rope also runs back. See too P. 46 b.

tota: see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

11. procis: sor its position see on P. ⁴7-

12. Tyrrhenus (ps): because the Etruscans were notoriously lax in morals.
See too P. 21.

13- temunen: see on P. 51.

¹⁴· amanum: for its position see on P. 48.

15. Pieria (p): compare on Thressa, Odes 3. 9. 9.

16. curvat should have stress (see on Ocres 4. 9. 26) i.e. ‘bend not, much
less brak)

17. perenn has sti-ess i.e. ‘spare‚ oh spare!’; again see on Odes 4. 9. 26,
and compare sospitant at Odes 3. 14. 10.

rigida...aenmlo: sor the grouping see on P. 24.

18. mamanibus: the grouping is that noted at P. 24, since animum
