86 HORACE

VIII.

Ulla si iuris tibi peierati
poena, Barine, nocuisset umquam,
dente si nigro fieres vel uno
turpior ungui,
crederem: sed tu simul obligasti 5
perfidum votis caput, enitescis

pulchrior multo iuvenumque prodis
publica cura.

expedit matris cineres opertos
fallere et toto taciturna noctis 10
signa cum caelo gelidaque divos

morte carentis.

26. bibendi (s): the effect of the position is a loving stress on ‘drinking,
drinking, drinking 2²

27, 28. Edonis has stress by separation from sanius.

recepto is at first substantiva] i.e. ‘I will get lively for one who has safely
returned‚’ and then amico comes as an emphatic addendum (see on P. 53)
i.e. ‘above all for one who is a friend.’

V111. 1, 2. Ulla (ps) has great emphasis.

tibi is first dative of the agent with peierati, then later object of nocuisset.
See note on vagae at Odes 1. 28. 23.

umquam (pp) has emphasis.

3, 4. dente comes first in contrast to ungui last.

nigro has some stress because separated from dente by si.

uno (s) i.e. ‘if only one (nail)' ; see too on P. 24. Editors speak of uno as
belonging to both dente and ungui, but the case is different from those cited
at P. 33. See also Conway’s article in the C. R. vol. 14, p. 358.

5. crederem is emphatic3 see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

tu is emphatic because inserted.

6. perfidum votis caput: the word volis is ablative in point of which with
perfidum, and ablative of the means with oblzgrastz'; compare on tibi l. 1 above.

7. pulchrior multo: these words are emphatic addenda3 see on P. 53.

multo (pp) has emphasis by position.

iuvenum (ps): this is 3 kind of pendent genitive (common in Greek) and
signifies loosely ‘as for the youths'; ultimately it is construed with cura. See
on P. 40.

8. publica (p) i.e. ‘open to 311,’ like a star for all to behold and enjoy
(compare Ovicl Her. 18. 150 publica...sz'dera‚ Ales. 6. 351, and ib. 2. 35); but
the emphasis on publica is a left-handed compliment.

9. expedit comes first with stress i.e. ‘it positively pays you,' λυσιτελεῖ καὶ
οὐ βλάπτει.
