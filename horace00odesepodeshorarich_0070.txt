34 HORACE

non Dindymene, non adytis quatit 5
mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius,
non Liber aeque, non acuta
si geminant Corybantes aera,

tristes ut irae, quas neque Noricus
deterret ensis nec mare naufragum 10
nec saevus ignis nec tremendo
Iuppiter ipse ruens tumultu.

fertur Prometheus addere principi
limo coactus particulam undique
desectam et insani leonis 15
vim stomacho apposuisse nostro.

irae Thyesten exitio gravi
stravere et altis urbibus ultimae
stetere causae, cur perirent
funditus imprimeretque muris 20

quem criminosis...modum Ι pones iambis: for the grouping see on P. 9.

old Apulian acquaintance living on the east coast of Italy.

5. adytis is placed early for emphasis; it is ‘opposed to the more widely
diffused afflatus, ἐνθουσιασμός, of Cybele or Bacchus’ (VVickham).

geminant3 see on P. 31.

11. saevus (p): see on Odes 2. 14. 23.

tremendo (ps): the word may be felt first with Iuppiter; see on P. 52,
and Epod. 6. 9. As Latin still waits for a noun to go with tremendo, there is
no real pause at ruens and the rhythm is thus less exceptional. See Page aal
