nescias an te generum beati

Phyllidis flavae decorent parentes:

regium certe genus et penatis ι,
maeret iniquos.

crede non illam tibi de scelesta
plebe dilectam, neque sic fidelem,
sic lucro aversam potuisse nasci
matre pudenda. πο

6. ἱοωιι...Τοαιιεωιοτ if captivae is an adjective, then the group captivae
dominum Tecmessae comes under P. 20 ο. But the order has two advantages:
it allows captivae... Tecmessae to be heard with sornm as well as with dome'num,
and it heightens the contrast os prisoner and master (compare note on
insolentem Ι. 2 above).

7. 8. mediomrnph: these words are really emphatic addenda (see on
P. 53); they carry the point viz. that in the very midst of his triumph the
victor was vanquished and that by a captive maiden.

medio (ps) i.e. ‘in the very midst ol'....¹ Compare Livy 34. 5. 8 mah’o in
soro, 7. ¹9· 3, and 4⁴· 35. 16.

9, ιο. barbarae (ps) in contrast to Thessalo (p). The antithesis is
‘foreigner and Greek.‘

emptus (p) i.e. ‘the loss (of Hector)’; see on Ρ. 26.

n, 12. ίαίὶι...ῦι·ιὶι; sor the grouping see on P. ιο. The juxtaposition
essessa} and leviora is happy: the weary have a lighter burden.

13. te ‘metm beati: a Roman, probably. would first read these words
together, as is we had te genero beatu indeed Horace is saying two things at
once: the parents who are proud of you as son-in-law may bring honour to
their son-indam See on Odes ι. ²3· 12.

14, rhyuidis (p) in artificial contrast to te. which is placed early in the
preceding line.

decorat by position may have some stress i.e. κοσμοῦσι καὶ οὐκ
οἶσχῦνσιὲσιυ. ,

parentet comes last with point i.e. ‘even her parents,¹ not to mention
herself.

Ι 5- regim (ps) has emphasis: she is a descendant of kiqes.
