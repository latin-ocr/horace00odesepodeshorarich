out-:s 111. 25-26 173

laevum marinae qui Veneris latus 3
custodit. hic. hic ponite lucida
funalia et vecte· et arcus
oppositis foribus minacis.

o quae beatam diva tenes Cyprum et
Memphin carentem Sithonia nive, ιο
regina, sublimi flagello
tange Chloen semel arrogantem.

2ο. cingentem...pampino is an emphatic causa! addendum (see on P. 3 3)
and - qm‘ppae qui cingat.

viridi ( ps) i.e. ‘the greenery (of the vine leaves)’; see on P. 27, and also
note on Odes 4. 8. 33.

ml. This Ode is, 1 suspect, a translation from the Greek, and, lnke
Odes 3. 2ο, is not a complete success.

1. Vixi comes oerly with emphasis i.e. ‘lt is all over'3 compare Vergil
Aen. 2. 325s1a’nens Troes.

2. non sine cleda: the postposited adverb-phrase ε ηιιιτύηα cum
gloria.

5. kentuwinus: for the gmuping see on P. ια

ὁ. metodit should have stress (see on odes 4. 9. 26). The left side is, con-
ventionally, the unprotected side. Compare latus claudere i.e. In n'trrlrtra
ambulare (see Duff on Juvenal 3. 131).

tudda (ωε perhaps ‘the glemu (of waxened ropes)'; see on P. 27.

7, 8. atem...minaeis: sor the grouping see on P. 18.

opponitis (p) i.e. ‘the opposition (of doors)'; see on P. 2⁶, and compare
Odes 1. 11. 5.

9. quae...Cyprum: for the grouping see on P. 9.

beatam diva: a Roman might feel these words to mean ‘blessed in its
godel-ssu see on odes 1. 35. 1.

Cyprum et: see on Odes 1. 35. 39.

ιο. earmtem...r²ive: this ἰε, apparently, an artificial rendering οἱ Bacchy·
lides' δχσίμοηου Μέμφιν. The preposited Sithonia is somewhat pointless, even
though the snows of Chalcidice might be proverbial. To speak os a place
where snow never falls as ‘free from Arctic snows' is worthy os our eighteenth
century versifiers.

The words Sithonia nive may stand outside Memphin and carentem
because we still vait sor the obJect οἱ carentum see on P. 47, and compare
Odes 1. 28, 1.

11, 12. sublimi (p) makes tange a paraprosdokian sor caede. Compare
Odes 3. 29. 63, 64. The adverb semel postposited and separated goes with
lange and heightens the paraprosdokian i.e. ‘touch her and once only!

“10th (s) is causal, ‘for her disdain' (dre σεμνὴν γενομὶνην); or it
might be concessive. Τὴε grouping Chloen semet arrogantem need not, of
necessity. mean ‘Chloe once disdainsul’; see on P. 50 c.
