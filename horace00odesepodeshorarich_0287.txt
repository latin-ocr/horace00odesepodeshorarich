EPODES 5-6 ²⁴9

petamque vultus umbra curvis unguibus.
quae vis deorum ωε manium.
et inquietis assidens praecordiis ⁹3
pavore somnos auferam.
vos turba vicatim hinc et hinc saxis petens
contundet obscenas anus;
post insepulta membra different lupi
et Esquilinae alites, ιοο
neque hoc parentes, heu mihi superstites,
effugerit spectaculum.'

Vl.

Quid immerentis hospites vexas canis
ignavus adversum lupos?

quin huc inanis, si potes, vertis minas
et me remorsurum petis?

nam qualis aut Molossus aut fulvus Lacon, 5
amica vis pastoribus¹

93. umbra and curvis unguibus are unpleasant addenda <see on Ρ. 53).

curvis (p): the stress on ‘curved' adds to the abomination ; the spirit has
become a sort of Harpy.

94. deorum (s) seems to be quasi-adjectival‚ as is we had divi manes
(Lucretius 6. 759) i.e. such is the might os the Manes, who have dr'm'ne
powers.

95. inquietis (ps) is proleptic i.e. ‘so that they are restless'; see on P. 3ο,
and also on P. 2⁴ and ²5·

98. obscenas (p): see on odes 2. ¹4· ²3· The two words obscenas anus
are causal addenda (see P. 53).

99- insepulta (p) is causal.

ιοο. Esquilinae (p) is quasi-generic i.e. ‘carrion (birds)·; see on P. 37.

ιοι. hoe is emphatic by far separation. They shall not miss eleis sight, if
they do miss what is going on now.

vl. ι. immerentis (p) is concessive i.e. ⁸ though they do not deserve it.¹
Compare inmerentis (ps) of ΕΜ 7. ¹9· The whole point of the Epode
lies in immerentis: the innocent should not be attacked by the writer os
lampoons.

2. ignavus i.e. ‘though a coward (against wolves).'

3. inanis (ps) is proleptic i.e. ‘so that they fall powerless’3 see on P. 3ο.

minas t'or its position see on odes ι. 3. 1⁶.

5. rutvm appears to be dm) κοινοῦ with Molossus and Las-otu see on P. 33.

6. amieo vis pastoribus: sor the order see on P. 47.
