ODES 1. 36-37 ⁶9

XXXVll.

Nunc est bibendum. nunc pede libero
pulsanda tellum nunc Saliaribus

ornare pulvin r deorum
tem‘ptss era dapibus, sodales.
ahtzhac nefas depromere Caecubum 3
cellis avitis. dum Capitolio
regina dementis ruinas
su‘nus et ifnderio parffb&
contaminatossum grige turpium
mtsrbo virorlim, quidlibet impotens ιο
sperare fortunaque dulci
ebria sed minuit furorem

novo (s): i.e. ‘because new'; such a woman as Damalis must have change.
See also P. 21.

20. lucivin (me Damalis is more wanton than ‘the wantonness (of the
ivy) ’ς see on P. 27. The ivy was associated with the dubious rites of Bacchus,
quite apart from its clinging qualities.

xxxvn. This Ode, 1 venture to think, shows signs of the hasty work-
manship of a [aurate writing to order, eg. the awkward nunc est...nunc...
em! os u. 1-4; the exceptional metre of l. 5: the metre and order of l; 14;
the order of daret ut (1. 20), and the strange reparaw't of Ι. 24. See also on
Odes3. 14.11111ᾱ 4. ¹4· 1.

2. Saliaribus (ps): i.e. with a banquet fit sor the Salii, not with the meagre
offerings os ordinary ritual- For generic adjectives preposited or separated
see P. 37.

6, 7. cenis avitis is an addendum with stress (see on P. 53); it had been
nefas to drink the oldest Caecuban.

Capitolio Ι regina: the juxtaposition os these words (see Odes 1. 2. 17)
and the emphasis on Capitolio are effective. ‘A Queen on the Capitol' is too
awful to contemplate; a rex would be bad enough.

danen& (ωε the epithet is felt, as Gow says really with regina (see on
P. 52). The ruinae are the dreams of madness.

9-12. contaminato...ebria: these words form an emphatic addendum
(see on P. 53). She was preparing destruction for the empire and how?
with a body os effeminate eunuchs, herself without control and—drunkt

9. contaminato eum grege turpium: for the grouping see on P. 34. and
35. Probably contaminato (ps) has emphasis i.e. ‘utterly polluted.’

10. φιὶάὶἰδοῒ has stress by separation from sperare: she has no control
over expectationis and those expectations are chimerical.

· ¹2. ebria: for the stress see on Odes 4. 9. 26,
