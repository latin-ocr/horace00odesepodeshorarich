46 HORACE

atqui non ego te tigris ut aspera
Gaetulusve leo frangere persequor: γ ιο
tandem desine matrem
tempestiva sequi viro.

XXIV.

Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus

tarn cari capitis? praecipe lugubris

cantus, Melpomene, cui liquidam pater
vocem curn cithara dedit.

ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor 5
urget? cui Pudor et Iustitiae soror, Α
incorrupta Fides, nudaque Veritas

quando ullum inveniet parem?

9, 10. ego te tigris ut: the case relations are grouped early; see on Odes
1. 2. 17. For the position of ut see on Odes 1. 15. 29.

Note the chiasmus tzgris...aspera Ι Gaetulusve leo.

12. sequi: the position is startling. Is it only to give viro stress in con-
trast to matrem? But Horace seems to be saying two things in one ex-
pression (see Odes 1. 27. 23, 24, 1. 37. 18, 2. 4. 13, and 4. 4. 61) viz. ‘cease to
follow your mother, you who are ripe for a husband to follow’ i.e. sequi first
depends on desine, then on tempestiva. Observe that Horace could have
written viro sequi, and therefore metrical convenience has nothing to do with
the order3 compare Odes 1. 14. 10.

XXIV. 1, 2. desiderio and tarn cari capitis are the important ideas: there
is nothing to be ashamed of in regrets, above all for one so clear. Hence
desiderio comes early and lam cari capitis is separated from it. Moreover
tam cari capitis may also be felt with pudor and modus i.e. ‘in reference to
so dear a person.'

tam cari (p): the sense demands stress; compare Odes 1. 22. 21.

lugubris (p): a sad song from the Muse of Tragedy (pace Wickham).
See too on Odes 2. 14. 23.

3. liquidam (ᾡς) i.e. a melting voice, not merely claram, ungulam etc.
In Vergil Georg. 1. 410 liquida seems to mean ‘ soft.'

5. Quintilium...s0p0r: for the order see P. 51.

perpetuus (p): sopor is the vox propria for unconsciousness; this un-
consciousness lasts not for a few moments but for ever. English acliieves
the same emphasis by making the adjective come after the noun—‘the
sleep unbroken.'

6. urget: the position makes the pressure all the heavier; see on Odes
4. 9. 26.

Iustitiae (p): see on Ι). 41 atisin.
