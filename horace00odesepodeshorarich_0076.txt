40 HORACE

et lasciva Licentia
finitis animum reddere amoribus.

urit me Glycerae nitor 5
splendentis Pario marmore purius,
urit grata protervitas
et vultus nimium lubricus aspici.
in me tota ruens Venus
Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas ιο
et versis animosum equis
Parthum dicere nec quae nihil attinent.
hic vivum mihi caespitem, hic
verbenas, pueri, ponite turaque
bimi curn patera meri: 15
mactata veniet lenior hostia.

2. Thebanae (βψ the strained order seems to have no explanation save
metrica] convenience. But Thebanae may=‘from Thebes' (see on Odes
1. 31. 9) in contrast to Venus from Cyprus.

Semelae puer: sor the order see on P. 41.

3. lasciva (p): i.e. the wantonness (of Licentia); see on Ρ. 27. But com-
pare also on Odes 1. 7. 5.

4. finitis (ps): i.e. that were finished and done for (so I thought); corn-
pare relictos at Odes Ι. 34. 5.

5. Glycerae (p): for the position see on P. 38.

6. splendentis...purius is an emphatic addendum ; see on P. 53.

Pario (p) i.e. the whitest and most brilliant of marbles.

purius has emphasis because placed after and far separated from
splendentis.

7. grata (p): a woman’s protervitas may easily be ingrata if carried
too far; but grata (p) may simply mean ‘the charm (of coquetry)' ; see on
P. 27.

9. tota is predicative with ruens i.e. swooping full on me.

11, 12. versis... Ι Parthum: for the grouping see on P. 9. But animosum
naturally lies between versis and equis because the Parthian's courage comes
out only as he flies away.

13. vivum (ps): ritual seems to have demanded that the sod should be
fresh cut; hence the order.

15. bimi curn patera meri: for the grouping see on P. 2011. New wine
was required for sacrifices. See on odes 1. 31. 2, 3 and 3. 23. 3.

16. mactata (ps): a Roman in reading this word would think merely of
the verbal idea i.e. slaughter and its completion (compare explorato eto).
Thus the line would be read by him ‘ after slaughter she will be more kindly
by reason of my offering‚’ where hostia now becomes a causa} ablative. See
on P. 26, and compare (Mes 4. 11. 7, 8. But the inevitable stress on mactata
