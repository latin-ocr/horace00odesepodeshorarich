¹111. 1, 2. adnm (ps)...⁸acri1ega (p): such words os indignation
are naturally stressed. Compare triste (p) at 1. 11, and see on Odes 2.
14. 23.

die: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

3, 4. nepotum Ι perniciem opprobriumque pagi: note the chiasmus,

5. parentis (μὴτ a father’s neck. not to mention a less important
person.

sui (s): his own father, not to mention his neighbour's.

7. nocturno (ὣς the murder a! myli! adds to the horror (compare
ΕΜ 5. 20). Horace always has nocturnus preposited or separated. See also

8. hocpitis very properly has emphasis (see on Odes 4. 9. 26). For the

12. &ruini (p) and immerentis (s): the two enormities are (1) that it

caducum see on P. 47.

14. in horu (pp): the point is that man has not warning from lwur to
laour. Certain definite dangers he dreads and avoids.

15. Thymn (s); the sense is: ‘the Bithynian sailor scars the Bosporus:
