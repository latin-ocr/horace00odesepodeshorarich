PREFACE

HE text used in this edition is that of Dr Gow, with few

and unimportant modifications.
1 am greatly indebted to my assistant iecturer‚ Mr D. Η.
ΗοΙΙίἀςε, MA, who read through the whole os the book in
manuscript and made many valuable suggestions. My thanks

also are due to my daughter, who helped me in the tiresome
work of prod-reading. But sor her and the reader of the Uni-

versity Press the number of errors would have been great.
