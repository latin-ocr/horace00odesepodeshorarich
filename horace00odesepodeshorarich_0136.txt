the dangers of his own corner of the world. Poenus (s) of the MSS=‘ even
though a skilled sailor' (if Poenus can mean ‘Phoenician').

15. ultra: sc. Bosphorum.

16. caeca...fata: for the grouping with intrusive timet see on P. 46 a.

17. celerem (p) i.e. ‘the swiftness (of flight)' ; see on P. 27. It may be
that celerem is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with sagittas and sugam (see on P. 33), but the
phrase looks like an awkward reminiscence of Odes 2. 7. 9, and Bentley’s
reducem is tempting, for the preposited adjective gives point to the oxymoron
(see on Epod. 5. 82).

17, 18. celerem fugam Ι Parthi: for the grouping see on P. 35.

18. Parthi, by position, has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26>; its position helps
out this curious series of artificial antitheses i.e. the Poenus fears the Bosporus,
the Roman fears the Parthian, and the Parthian fears a Roman prison. For
a similar but terser effort see Odes 3. 6. 46-48.

18, 19. Italum is ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with catenas and rabum see on P. 33.

19. robur has stress (see on Odes 4. 9. 26). Its very position seems to
suggest the finality of a life sentence. Compare custos at Odes 3. 4. 79.

20. gentis: for its position see on Odes 1. 3. 16.

21. quarn paene goes with the whole sentence (see on odes 2. 9. 13).
Contrast paene at Odes 3. 6. 13.

furvae regna Proserpinae: for the grouping see on P. 20 ιι.

22. iudicantem is predicative i.e. ‘on his judgement-seat.’

23. piorum has a half comic stress3 Horace imagines himself in the place
where a great gulf is fixed, but (he adds) on the right side of it. Probably
dz'scrzptas colours both sedes ancl piorum. Compare on odes 1. 19. 1, and see
P. 49.

piorum et: see on Odes 1. 35. 39.
24, 25. Aeoliis (p): the order may draw attention to the fact that Sappho,

though a Lesbiam wrote in Aeolic. Note the adverbial phrases Aeoliis
fidibus and puellis de popularibus placed on either side of querentem. Corn-

pare Odes 2. 7. 1, 2, and see on P. 34 adfin.
