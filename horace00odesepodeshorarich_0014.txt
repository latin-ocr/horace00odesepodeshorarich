x INTRODUCTORY

Dark Ages such niceties as word-order were forgotten. But, as
I have said, there are a few survivals. In Spanish, for instance,
an adjective may precede the noun for emphasis; thus ‘a mag-
nzficent day!’ is ‘un magnifico dias’ Then there is what may be
called the emphasis of emotion. This can be seen in Spanish‚
French, and Italian. Contrast the cold classification of un escrz‘tor
pobre (i.e. poor, not rich) with un pobre escritor (i.e. wretched,
unfortunate, miserable). Parallels in French and Italian will be
found quoted at ἐξ 34 and 36 of my Prolegomena and elsewhere
in the notes. Those who know the Romance languages better
than I do will, Ι doubt not, supply many more examples.
