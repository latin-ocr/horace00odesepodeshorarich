est qui nec veteris pocula Massici

nec partem solido demere de die :o
spernit. nunc viridi membra sub arbuto

stratus, nunc ad aquae lene caput sacrae.

multos castra iuvant et lituo tubae

permixtus sonitus bellaque matribus

detestata. manet sub love frigido ι,
venator tenerae coniugis immemor,

seu visa est catulis cerva fidelibus,

seu rupit teretis Marsus aper plagas,
me doctarum hederae praemia frontium

19. veteris (ps): Massic wine is good, but old Massic better. See also
P. 208.

20. partem solido i.e. ⁸ part from whole’ (solidus ὅλος); hence the order
os artificial antithesis e.g. unus omnia etc. For solido demae de die see Ρ. 21.

21. spernit: the verb should have stress; see on Odes 4. 9. 26.

viridi (ps) i.e. under the greenery (os the arbutus)'; see P. 27, and on
Odaes 4. 8. 33.

22. mauu: stretched idly; an important part os the picture; hence the
stress. See on Odes 4. 9. 26.

ad aquae lene caput uerae: sor the order sec P. 18. lt' is only a slight
extension of the frequent type aquae caput sacrae (see on P. 20 a); but
a Roman would md the words as they come—⁸ near water gently springing
(capno at the shrine: sor springs were sacred and had their shrine and altar.

23. multos castra. see P. 51 and on l 7 above.

. 23. 24. lituo tubae Ι permixtus sonitus: the normal prose order would be

per-numus lituo somms tubae (see P. 48), or pmntxtus lituo tubae sanutus.
Horace wishes us to hear both instruments early, as is we had lituus tubaque.
‚with permittas som‘tus in apposition. Compare Odes 4. 1. 22. For permixtus
(p), the confusion (of sound) sec P. 26, and sor tubae perminus sons'tus
see P. 49.

25. manet: comes first with stress—he stays on and on.

26. tenerae (p): because she is delicate he ought to have remembered
her. Compare Odes 1. 21. 1.

coniugis: the word lies between venator and Immemor according to rule
(see on Odes 1. 7. 29); but, in any case, objective genitives tend to bc pre-
positive (see P. 39).

27. fidelibus (s): because they have faithfully remained, they have seen
the quari-y.

28. ten-etis Uersus aper plagas: sor the grouping see on P. 10. The
adjective teretis goes closely with rupit and may mean either “ because slenderx
or ⁴ though strong)

29. me: forits position see P. 51, and compare L 30 nae...uemus (secundm.
