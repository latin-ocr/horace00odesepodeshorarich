quo pinus ingens albaque populus
umbram hospitalem consociare amant. ιο
† ramisque et obliquo laborat
lympha fugax trepidare rivos}

huc vina et unguenta et nimium brevis
flores amoenae ferre iube rosae.
dum τα et aetas et sororum ι,
fila trium patiuntur atra.

cedoe coemptis saltibus et domo

te in teneto i.e. ‘yoursels in your privacy'; see on (Mes ι. 2. 17.

renovo (p): the word has stress because retirement to the hills (eg. to
Tivoli) is part of the happiness.

8. inveniere nota Falerni is an emphatic addendum (see on P· 53); sor
the grouping see on P. 35. The effect is to stress the age of the wine
(inten‘ore is like manarum at Odes 3. 28. 2) and its high quality (Palem).
The normal order inten‘ore Falerni nota would not bring out the points so
clearly. For the position os interiore see also P. 28.

9. pinu· ingan albaque populus: note the chiasmus and compare odes
1. 25. 17, 18, 19. ln the word ingens (pp) lurks the idea os ‘dark shade'
(contrast aloa preposited).

11. nmis: the true reading os this line can scarcely be recovered. To
take rm] with consociare amant is not easily desensible; sor ramis would
acquire a meaningless emphasis under P. 53 and under the principle noted
at Odaes ⁴- 9. 26. Compare ventis at Odes 3. ιο. 7, 8.

One may accept provisionally a comma aster amant, and a comma aster
rivo, reading ramisque et obliquo, and allowing the leucos l. 13 to picit up the

ramique et obliquo (ps) i.e. the water struggles with fallen branches and
the bend (see on P. 27) in the river. ln fact a Roman would read the lines
thus: ‘with branches and the bend labours the speeding water to hasten
dmm the stream) Compare Odes 2. 5. 7.

13, 14. nimium brevio Ι flores unoenae...rosae: sor the grouping see

m (ps) Le. ‘sor an its beauty,’ it too must die. Α Roman may feel
amoenae withstores also (see on P. 52).

ις, 16. mentm (p) is the real subject; see on P. 38.

⁸oeomm lflla trium...atra: for the grouping see on P. 16 α. The position
of alra at the end adds to the sombre colour of the line.

17. οοαιιρὶἰι(ῥ) i-e. ⁸(you will abandon) the buying up of... ’ (see on P. 26³.
An his purchases os estates will come to nothing; he will have to leave them.
