152 HORACE

i, pete unguentum, puer, et coronas
et cadum Marsi memorem duelli,
Spartacum siqua potuit vagantem
fallere testa. 20

dic et argutae properet Neaerae

murreum nodo cohibere crinem;

si per invisum mora ianitorem
fiet, abito.

lenit albescens animos capillus ²5
litium et rixae cupidos protervae;
non ego hoc ferrem calidus iuventa

consule Planco.

1 1, 12. Amid the welter of various readings and emendations there is little
use in discussing order ; but whether we accept male omz'natis or male
inominatis the epithet has some stress by separation. See on Odes 2. 14. 23,
and P. 21.

13, 14. atras Ι eximet curas: for the position of atras (prettily kept close
to its antithesissestus) see on P. 21, and Odes 2. 14. 23.

15, 16. per vim (pp) has stress.

tenente Ι Caesare terras: terras may stand outside according to the prin-
ciple noted at P. 47. The effect is to stress terras somewhat i.e. ‘while Caesar
is master of the world) For the position of terras compare Odes 4. 14. 22
Pleiadum choro scindente nubes, and for the ablative absolute last see on Odes
3. 1. 34.

18, 19. cadum...duelli: for the grouping see on P. 14.

Marsi (ps): its position emphasizes the age of the wine, as does the posi-
tion of Spartacum. See also P. 21, since memorem is the equivalent of a verb3
compare cupidos l. 26 below.

21. argutae (ps)...Neaerae: although datives‚ the words are also logical
subject os properet, and the grouping is that of P. 21 3 for similar examples
see P. 23.

22. murreum: unless we read cohibente (for grouping see P. 15), the order
of murreum seems pointless 3 but the meaning of murreum is too uncertain
for dogmatism.

nodo: see on Odes 2. 11. 24.

23. invisum (ps) i.e. ‘the disagreeableness (of the doorkecper)'; see on
P. 27, and Odes 2. 14. 23.

25. lenit cornes early with stress i.e. lenit, non irritat.

25, 26. albescens...cupidos: for the grouping see on P. 17. The stress is
on albescens, which suggests the antithesis iuventa proterva.

litium et rixae: see on P. 39.

rixae cupidos protervae: as cupidos is equal to cupientes, the grouping
comes under P. 21 ; compare memorem l. 18 above.
