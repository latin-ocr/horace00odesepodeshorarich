236 HORACE ’

forumque vitat et superba civium
potentiorum limina.
ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
altas maritat populos, 10
aut in reducta valle mugientium
prospectat errantis greges,
inutilisve falce ramos amputans
feliciores inserit,
aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris, 15
aut tondet infirmas ovis;
vel cum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Autumnus agris extulit,
ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira,
certantem et uvam purpurae, ιο
qua muneretur te, Priape, et te, pater
Silvane, tutor finium.
libet iacere modo sub antiqua ilice,
modo in tenaci gramine:

10. altas (ps) has point ; the vines, as Wickham says, ‘are now grown large
enough to clamber a tree which would have been too tall for them before.’
See too P. 21.

11, 12. reducta (p) i.e. ⁶ in the depths (of the valley)'; see on P. 26.

mugientium (ps) ε the order is as if we had mugitus prospectat (exaudit)
errantium gregum. It is the mugitus that makes him look. He looks and
descries the wanderers. Thus both mugientium and errantis are the impor-
tant parts of the picture, and normal order (errantis mugientium greges) is
forsaken. For mugientium (ps) see on P. 38, and, for the grouping, P. 43.

13. inutilis (ps) i.e. ‘because useless '; contrast too feliciores. The result
is an awkward position offalce; see on P. 50 d.

15. pressa...amphoris: for the grouping see on P. 9.

16. infirmas (p) ovis almost equals infirmitatem ovium (see on P. 27),
just as tarditatem Lepidi means ‘the slow Lepidus'; but infirmas is also
causal: only because sheep are unresisting can they be shorn. Compare
Epist. 1. 16. 14 infirmo capiti...utilz·s i.e. ‘ useful for weakness in the head.'

17. decorum mitibus pomis caput: for the grouping see on P. 10. But
mitibus (p) may be intentional; contrast ‘unripe.’ The order is then normal
(see on Odes 1. 7. 29).

19. insitiva (ps): the owner feels an additional pleasure in pears which
he has artificially produced. See also P. 21.

20. purpurae probably has stress by its position outside certantem and
uvam3 but see P. 47 and P. 49. Compare too on l. 60 below.

23. antiqua (p): age implies shade and charm.
