70 HORACE

vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
mentemque lymphatam Mareotico ⁶
redegit in veros timores 15
Caesar, ab Italia volantem

remis adurgens, accipiter velut
mollis columbas aut leporem citus
venator in campis nivalis
Haemoniae, daret ut catenis 20

fatale monstrum. quae generosius
perire quaerens nec muliebriter
expavit ensem nec latentis
classe cita reparavit oras;

ausa et iacentem visere regiam 2 5
vultu sereno, fortis et asperas
tractare serpentes, ut atrum
corpore combiberet venenum,

13. sospes (p) i.e. ‘the safety os...,' as if we had πνῖιαίας see on P. 26.

ab ignibus, separated from sospeS, has point (see on P. 49): after Antony’s
ssight his captains fought desperately, and it was not until the ships were
fired that the contest was decided.

14. mentemque...Mareotico: the metre is as exceptional as the order (for
the latter see on P. 49); her hallucinations (lymphatam) are due to some
mysterious Egyptian wine.

15. veros (p): contrast the imaginary horrors implied in lymphatam.

16. Caesar: for the stress (i.e. ‘great Caesar³) see on Odes 4. 9. 26, and
compare Odes 1. 2. 44.

17. accipiter velut: for the order compare on Odes 1. 15. 29.

18. mollis (ὣς contrast the cruel strength os a hawk.

citus is felt, despite the case, with both leporem and venator (see P. 52);
it is preposited with venator because a quick hunter is needed to catch a
quick hare. Compare too on Odes 1. 23. 12.

19, 20. nivalis: the epithet is felt with both campis and Haemoniam with
the latter it is preposited because hares are most readily caught on the snow.

Haemoniae: there seems to be no point in its position; see on Odcs 4. 9. 26.

20. daret ut catenis: the position of daret has no point. One might
justify the order as a kind of tmesis, since dare catenis is equivalent to vin—
cz're; but Horace writes ut immediately after the verb at Oa'cs 4. 13. 26, Epod.
16. 31, Sal. 1. 1. 26, 1. 4. 108, and 1. 5. 63. See too Odcs 4. 2. 26. Ovid has
many examples eg. En· Ponto 1. 3. 78, 1. 3. 83, 3. 6. 52, 4. t). 74, 4. 10. 16,
4. 16. 50, etc.

21. fatale <p): see on Odes 2. 14. 23.

23. latentis (ps) i.e. ‘a hiding-place (on the coast)⁷; see on P. 26.
