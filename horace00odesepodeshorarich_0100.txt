64 HORACE

te Dacus asper, te profugi Scythae
urbesque gentesque et Latium ferox 10
regumque matres barbarorum et
purpurei metuunt tyranni,

iniurioso ne pede proruas
stantem columnam, neu populus frequens
ad arma cessantis, ad arma 15
concitet imperiumque frangat:

te semper anteit saeva Necessitas,
clavos trabalis et cuneos manu
gestans aena, nec severus
uncus abest liquidumque plumbum: 20

pauper (ps) i.e. ‘because he is poor⁷ ; therefore he courts Fortuna and
with prayers that are anxious (sollicita preposited).

6. ruris (p) is contrasted with aequoris3 landsman and sailor alike
worship her.

7. Bithyna...carina: for the grouping see P. 10.

Bithyna practically equals ‘from Bithynia' (see on Calena at Odes 1. 31. 9).
There is point in both Bithyna (ps) and Carpathium (p): the trader from
Bithynia challenges the open sea (pelagus) and the whole length of the
dangerous Aegean. The worst part is the Carpathium, between Rhodes and
Crete, where he cannot merely coast along. Compare Myrtoum, Odes 1. 1. 14
and Creticum 1. 26. 2.

9. te Dacus: see on 1. 5 above.

profugi (p): contrast asper (‘standing at bay‚' as &Vickham translates).
See on Odes 4. 14. 42.

10, 11. Latium ferox Ι regumque matres: the sense is in parallel order
i.e. free Latium in contrast to tyrants‚ and fiery warriors in contrast to weak
women.

regumque matres barbarorum: sor the grouping see on P. 20 β.

et: for its position see on l. 39 below.

12. purpurei (ps) i.e. ‘for all their finery and luxuriousness.' See also
P. 21.

13. iniurioso (ps) i.e. ‘with contumely (of the foot)'; see P. 27, and Odes
2. 14. 23. ·

14. stantem (p) i.e. ‘ however firmly set up.’

15. ad arma cessantis may well go together i.e. those who are laggards
‘at arming’ may be aroused ‘to arms.'

17. saeva (p): see on Odcs 2. 14. 23. But the reading serva ‘has the
balance of manuscript authority' (VVickham), and, to my mind, yields a
better sense. The question of questions is ‘Does Fortuna (τύχη) or Necessitas
(ἀνάγκη) rule?' Horace tells us the answer: Necessitas goes in front but
