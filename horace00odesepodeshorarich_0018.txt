xiv PROLEGOMENA [gg 5-7

ξ 5. But to return to Horace—the importance of bearing in mind these types is
seen clearly when we face such a derangement of epit—aQS as is provided by the corn-
mentators on Epod. 5. 19

iubet (Canidia) cupressos funebris

19 et uncta turpis ova ranae sanguine

plumamque nocturnae strigis. . .

flammis aduri Colchicis.
Here the editors offer a bewildering variety of interpretations. The most favoured
dogma appears to be that ova and plumam belong to strigis, and that we should
translate by ‘an owl's eggs and feathers smeared with blood of hideous toad.’ Some
commentators have their doubts, and well they may ; for if the conventional interpre-
tation be correct, Latin order z's a Chinese puzzle, and schoolboys should not be
permitted to spend valuable time on this exhilarating game. But if we follow the
principles of Latin poetic order as demonstrated in ἐξ 3, 4 above, we shall arrive
at conelusions less uncomplimentary to both Horace and Latin poetry.

The grouping uncta turpis ova ranae is simply that os type βῙ, and ranae goes with
both ova and sanguine, between which it lies. Ι submit therefore that 1. 19 must be
read by a Roman as ‘and eggs anointed of foul toad by its blood.' We may, if we
like, in the Horatian manner, supply unctam sanguine (strigis) with plumam. Dr A. S.
Way in his translation (Macmillan‚ 1898) says rightly

‘ And the spawn a loathly toad had voided, smeared with blood,
And the feather of a screech-owl, bird of gloom.'

§6. We even find three adjectives together followed by three nouns in more or
less parallel order. Ι know but two instances, however, in the Odes (the Epodes
afford no example) viz. Odes 1. 9. 21 and 2. 9. 13. The former runs thus:

latentis proditor intimo
'‘[gratus] puellae risus ab angulo.
Here proditor is a quasi-adjective, and a Roman would read the lines thus: ‘the
hider's betrayer within, the [sweet] girl laugh from the corner.’ The latter passage
(Odes 2. 9. 13¹) reads as follows: at non ter aevo functus amabilem Ι ploravit omnis
Antilochum senex Ι annos.... Compare too Vergil Georgy'cs 4. 371 et gemina auratus
taurino cornua voltu Ι Eridanus, and Horace Sat. 1. 5. 73 nam vaga per veterem
dilapso flamma culinam Ι Volcano....

Such methods are impossible for English, but Shakespeare does with nouus and
verbs something analogous in Ant. and Cleop. 3. 2. 17.

‘ Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho !
His love to Antony.’
The Variorum Edition of Shakespeare quotes a performance, even more surprising,
by Sir Philip Sidney—
‘ Vertue‚ beautie, and speeche, did strike‚ wound, charme
My heart, eyes, ears, with wonder, love, delight;
First‚ second, last did binde, enforse‚ and arme
His works, showes, sutes, with wit, grace, and vowes’ might....’

§ 7. It is convenient at this point to insert a complete list of types αῙ, αἳ, βῙ, and βῖ
in Horace's Odes, Epocles and C. S.
